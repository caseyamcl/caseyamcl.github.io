I went to Sea World on Saturday.  I went because my sister got me in for free.  The last time I was there was... I want to say seventh grade, so it's been over a decade.  I was surprised to see what hasn't changed .. and what has.

Apparently, cool looking sea creatures aren't enough for the theme-park-going populace these days (not for $50.00 admission anyhow).  Sure, they still have sharks and penguins and dolphins and such, but let's face it.. we as Americans don't really care unless they're on a plate with fries (available at the Sea World cafeteria).  I guess it's cool to see penguins and polar bears walking around a glass box if you're from Kenosha, Wisconsin and never seen salt water before.

Speaking of... I actually feel pretty bad for the dolphins in the petting area, who are, unfortunately for them, "cute looking" by nature.  As such, they spend all day living in a small pool being touched by thousands of five-year-olds who pick their nose an average of 7 times per minute.

The point is, however, that due to the prevailing opinion that animals are boring unless they are eating each other, Sea World has had to step it up a notch to continue to herd tourists through the gate.  Shamu isn't bringing home the bacon so much as he used to.  So, the park has, in the past few years, decided they needed to build a roller coaster.

And they did.  The "Kraken" roller coaster has absolutely nothing to do with the sea that I know of.  It was pretty fun to ride, though.  There were also two other thrill rides.  One was a ride called "Journey to Atlantis" in which you get in a boat, supposedly go to the plastic mechanical version of Atlantis, and then get very wet.  We abstained from riding.  The other is called, "Arctic something-or-another", which is a VR helicopter simulator designed to make you expel your lunch so that you'll have to go to one of the many Sea World restaurants and purchase more food.

We had a good time, though I don't think I would have paid to get in.  It is much more interesting to see animals out in the wild than to see them trying to navigate their way around a glass enclosure.  For example, instead of going to Sea World, walking to the penguin exhibit and looking at penguins, then walking to the polar bear exhibit and looking at polar bears, it would be much more entertaining to go out in the wild and watch polar bears eat penguins.

And now I realize that polar bears are Arctic and penguins are Antarctic...

Still, it would be cool.
