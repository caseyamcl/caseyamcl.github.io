Yes, this is a week late.  I've been busy...

It wasn't the experience of a lifetime, but it was worth the time.  I managed to procure a bunch of free stuff from vendors by feigning interest in whatever item they were attempting to sell, and I learned how to participate in a conference like the professionals do: by not attending sessions or doing anything else boring.

On Wednesday night, I went out; on Thursday night, I went out; on Friday night, I went out.  You get the picture.  It was great.  Anyhow.. blah blah blah.. <b>new subject</b>:

I am doing more traveling in the near future; this time I'm East-coasting it, with two road trips: one to New York City, and the other to Gettysburg.  Having just recently driven 3000 miles across the country, I said to myself, "You know what, me?  What could be more fun than getting back in a car and driving a few thousand more miles?"  I submit: nothing (excluding many things).

New York City will be good; my buddy Brian and I are headed to see two NYC girls (formerly FSU girls; they moved up in life).  They are supposedly going to feed us, which is good for Brian and I but not so much for them.  I recall Brian once consumed ten bean burritos in a row from Taco Bell, and I myself ate three pounds of macaroni, chili (from a can), and cheese mixed in a giant pot last week--that was before the enchiladas.  Rock on.

Knowing Brian, we will be pretty hungry, too, from all of the stopping on the side of the road looking for birds and stuff during our trip up.  ::Note to Danielle: better buy the really big turkey, and maybe a ham on the side, plus a few enchiladas::  We're going to also try to make it to the big Macy's parade in New York, which is just exciting as New Years in New York, only with less Tequila and more three-year-olds.

Then, after Christmas, since we're going to be in the holiday spirit and all, my brother Jake and I are heading up to Gettysburg to see a field where a bunch of people died a horrible, gory, bloody death.  I can't wait.  Just to prep for the trip and sound like I know something about history, I am watching the PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/civilwar/">Civil War Series</a>.  That way, when we get there, I can impress my brother by rubbing my chin thoughtfully and saying things like, "Ah, yes, this is the exact location where General John Goober was killed when he accidentally cocked his musket incorrectly and shot his own horse."

That is all the news for now that you can get for free.  If you're interested in more, send me a check for $28.32, and I will send you a list of what I ate this week.
