So, here at devca.net (which doesn't really technically exist yet), we (meaning 'I') strive to use the most cutting edge technology available, and if that technology doesn't exist we (I) develop it.  Such is the case this past week, where, instead of doing real, actual work at my campus job, spent most of the week developing a php/MySQL-based commenting system, which I intend to make available as soon as I can make it (a) installable on other people's servers, and (b) work right <em>every time</em>.

In any case, it wasn't that complicated or difficult to implement, aside from the fact that I had never used MySQL before, I had never programmed in pHp before, and I certainly had never put the two together before!  However, things turned out okay.  I had a couple of stumbling blocks, but the routine was pretty much as follows.  (You may want to follow my 50-step approach if you wish to create your own php Commenting system for your website or weblog.
<ol>
	<li>Attempt to make a 'comments' table in my MySQL database using the "INSERT" clause.</li>
	<li>Attempt to make a 'comments' table in my MySQL database using the "INSERT" clause.</li>
	<li>Attempt to make a 'comments' table in my MySQL database using the "INSERT" clause.</li>
	<li>Bash head against wall repeatedly</li>
	<li>Attempt to make a 'comments' table in my MySQL database using the "INSERT" clause.</li>
	<li>Jump up in down in excitement, because it worked this time!</li>
	<li>Spend much time pondering what I did to make it work this past time that I didn't do before.</li>
	<li>Write some pHp code to access the database.</li>
	<li>Debug that code.</li>
	<li>Delete that code and write some different code to access the database.</li>
	<li>The code won't access the database!!!  #*(#@(*!  Why not?</li>
	<li>Realize I had the database access password typed wrong.</li>
	<li>Go outside and scream loudly.</li>
	<li>Sit back down.</li>
	<li>Get back up, and go to the vending machine.</li>
	<li>Sit back down.</li>
	<li>Get up and walk around aimlessly for at least 40 minutes.</li>
	<li>Sit back down.</li>
	<li>Decide that this whole database access thing should be in the form of an object-oriented Class.</li>
	<li>Attempt to learn object-oriented pHp in under 20 minutes.</li>
	<li>Spend two hours learning object-oriented pHp.</li>
	<li>Sob.</li>
	<li>Explain to the person at the desk next to me that I'm really okay, and I don't need the rest of the day off.</li>
	<li>Scold self for passing up the opportunity to get the day off.</li>
	<li>Test the new MySQL-comments database access class.</li>
	<li>It works!!! Oh my god! It #)#@() works!!</li>
	<li>Explain to the person at the desk next to me that I'm really okay, and he doesn't need to call the psychology ward.</li>
	<li>Build some JavaScript code to open a small "comments" window.</li>
	<li>Realize, upon finishing step 27, that I don't remember anything about JavaScript syntax.</li>
	<li>Rewrite JavaScript code.</li>
	<li>Rewrite JavaScript code.</li>
	<li>Rewrite JavaScript code.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 28-31.</li>
	<li>Find somebody else's JavaScript code and copy it.</li>
	<li>Convert 'Blogger' based weblog page from "static" HTML to dynamic "pHp" so I can call functions from it.</li>
	<li>Implement some code in the new pHp weblog page.</li>
	<li>It works!</li>
	<li>Wait, it doesn't work!</li>
	<li>.... [typetypetype] ... Okay, now it works!</li>
	<li>Realize it was time to go home three hours ago.</li>
	<li>Spend 5 minutes pondering whether to go home and be social or stay in front of the computer.</li>
	<li>Attempt to order pizza directly to desk.</li>
	<li>Find out that there was a "better" way to do this all along, and attempt to rebuild half the code from the ground up.</li>
	<li>Realize that "better" way was really moronic, after all.</li>
	<li>Rebuild the original code.</li>
	<li>Spend several hours trying to find out where that missing semicolon goes.</li>
	<li>Seriously ponder what would happen if I were to drive the letter opener through my ear and into my brain.</li>
	<li>Spend several hours changing almost every aspect of the program.</li>
	<li>Fall asleep on desk</li>
	<li>Wake up and realize that I've just, in my sleep, subconsciously figured out how to solve all the problems with it!</li>
	<li>Finish the program!</li>
</ol>
And there you have it!  Now that you know how I did it, you, too, can write your own pHp commenting system!  Good luck and may God have mercy on your soul!
