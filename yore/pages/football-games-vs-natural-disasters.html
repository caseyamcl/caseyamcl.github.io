Today I participated in the monthly Campus Networking Committee meeting.  This is where all of the campus networking nerds get together, sit around, and come up with things to talk about until 5:00 p.m. so that they don't have to do any work when they get back to their offices.  It works out well.

I did learn one important thing at the meeting today, which is, of course, the new policy on campus regarding football games.  Basically, the rules are these:

(1) If your car is in a faculty/staff parking lot the Friday night before a Saturday game past 5:30 p.m., your car will be towed away to make way for important tailgating guests.

(2) If you are at work on the afternoon of a game (in some buildings), then you must vacate to make way for very important tailgating guests.

At the University Center on Friday afternoon, I heard that trucks from various companies are actually lined up, ready to remove cars from parking spaces that certain staff and faculty pay $250.00 a year for.

The message is clear:  Everybody must vacate.  I even heard a friend of mine state that campus police interrupted one of his graduate seminars the day before a game to inform the students and staff that they must move their cars out of the parking lot to make way for the football game the next day.  On game weekends, most academic buildings, even in the absence of staff, are left unlocked by campus authorities in order to allow football fans to use the resterooms and such.  It's a bit ludicrous.

Of course, the "important guests" that the University makes such radical preparations for during game weekends cause issues of their own once they start showing up.  For two or three days, FSU campus is turned into a sea of tents, RV's, and lawn chairs filled with thousands of yokels from places like Stinkwater, Florida, and Fartville, Alabama who have come here to particpate in what may be the pinnicle of their existence: live football.  Of course, some of them come, but don't have tickets to the game, so they just watch it inside their RV on television.  The guests dig up the intramural fields, park themselves all over the green, plug their regridg-o-matics and 60" portable TV's into our buildings' power outlets via 180 foot heavy-duty extension cables, and tear up most everything in their wake.

It's no wonder I liken football games to natural disasters.  On Friday before the game, Uniersity staff frantically make a lot of the same preperations as we would for an impending hurricane (locking down servers, relocating vital equipment, setting automated security policies, leaving only vital services available, etc.), and then, like we would for a looming monstrosity in the Gulf, we get in our cars and get the hell away as quickly as possible.  The looming monstrosity in the case of football games, of course, is generally coming from the direction of I-10 in the form of motor-carriages, Winnebagos, and pickup trucks.

The day after a game resembles that of a natural disaster as well.  This past Monday, FSU beat Miami for the first time since the Regan Administration, and the next morning the signs of a recent party were immenet.  The entire campus (no exaggeration) was strewn with thousands of empty beer bottles and other various garbage items.  There were acres and acres of trash, mostly beer bottles, some still in tact and some shattered, having recently been thrown from a moving car.  The beer industry must be running some pretty successful advertising campaigns for this many people to be drinking beer at the same time.

Often times in the past, after games, dozens of lightpoles around campus would be knocked down; there would be graffiti all over buildings (from our own fans, nonetheless! "FSU RuLZ", "GO NOLES", etc.); and, of course, most outdoor areas would look as if hundreds of cars did donughts repeatedly.  It wasn't that bad this past weekend, but this is only the beginning of the season.

Sometimes, it feels that if FSU is the adament about football and interested in bringing in thousands of poeple who are sure to cause weeks of cleanup and huge interruptions in the University, we should just get rid of those pesky academic buildings taking up space, turn them into bars and garages for RV's, and then rename FSU to the "Florida State Football Emporium".

Hey, it's just a thought.  On a more relevant note, the saddest part of all of this was that on Saturday and Sunday, local motels and hotels started kicking hurricane refugees out in order to make way for guests coming for the Miami game.  FSU emptied out all of the refugees from the RV lot across from the stadium to make way for fans on Saturday as well.  Guess football is more important than community service.

Maybe we <em>shoud have</em> changed our mascot to the "FSU Cockroaches", per the NCAA.  Kidding, of course.. In all seriousness, we really should be the FSU "Beer Drinkin' Yokels".
