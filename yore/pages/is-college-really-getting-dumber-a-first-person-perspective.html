This will commence a series of posts I plan to publish regarding some of the, for lack of a better descriptive phrase, completely retarded things that happen in classrooms here at FSU.  Being an undergraduate student, I get to experience all of the fun first-hand.
Today's example will consist of the one-hour of wasted time spent in an Information Studies course while a group of mutinous students succesfully diverted the professor's attention from actually doing anything remotely productive while the class argued about "how to turn assignments in", etc.  What really happened was a game we used to play in high school wherein the teacher asks the students if they don't understand something about classroom policy (e.g. "Do any of you not understand the submission policy for assignments?"), and the students begin responding with numerous questions that nobody really cares about, but waste enough class time to avoid actually learning something.  These consist of questions such as:
<ul>
	<li>"How many words does it have to be?"</li>
	<li>"Is it double-spaced?"</li>
	<li>"Do I have to do any research besides what you stated in the lecture for this paper?"</li>
	<li>"Can I turn the paper in late without getting any deduction in my grade?"</li>
	<li>"Can I turn it in written in Greek?"</li>
	<li>"How about if I write the paper backwards, and then ball it up?  Can I still get full credit?"</li>
	<li>etc, and so on and so forth.</li>
</ul>
Eventually, however, the students run out of questions pertaining to the actual assignment and begin asking anything they can to eat up class time.  This charade went on for almost exactly one hour today in a 3000-level college class I'm taking.  One girl went so far as to state (and I'm not exaggerating) that the professor has the responsibility of putting all of the lecture notes online because she (the student) often dozes off in class and sometimes doesn't feel like coming.

My question is, what professor with an IQ above that of dog meat would allow such an obvious charade of laziness to continue in the classroom?  Did the professor simply not realize that the students were wasting time, or did she actually endorse the shameless use of classtime (that most people taking the course--or their parents--paid for) to argue with students over some things that should have been taken care of either on the syllabus or just using plain old common sense.

So, today, I avoided having to actually learn anything at college.  Maybe tomorrow I can sit in for another exciting debate between the desperately-trying-to-teach even-though-I -have-no-standards professor and the I'd-rather-be-playing-Nintendo-because-I-plan-on-moving -back-in-with-my-parents-and-staring -at-the-refridgerator-daily students.  Stay tuned in for more...
