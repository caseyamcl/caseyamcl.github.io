The fact of the matter is, some people are made to work seven days a week, twelve hours a day.  Their purpose of their entire lives is to slave away behind some desk somewhere until they eventually die or quit.  Up until May 1, I was one of those people.  Then the semester ended.  Now I have weekends again, and it is, to say the least, weird.

Now, weekends are great, but there's always that uneasy feeling on Sunday night knowing that the next day.. Monday morning, I will be sitting behind some desk somewhere staring at computer screens that say stuff like, <b>"You have 1,304,209 unread messages</b>" and, <b>"Warning, Fatal Error #2039402; All Documents Have Been Deleted"</b> and, <b>"C:\asdf;234o234)#)(#$200---> Type Command Here"</b>.  It's not much to look forward to at 8:00 a.m., but I've developed a few survival strategies that are sure to keep me going.

These days, I'm working at Job #2 on Monday, which is the "peer advising" job, which in reality consists mostly of (a) pushing the 'start' button on the copy machine when requested, (b) taking the mail from the downstairs to the upstairs, (c) collecting rubber bands in my rubber band collection cup, and (d) asking students to please sign in and then forcing them to wait for ludicrous and unnecessary amounts of time before acknowledging their existence again.  The last of these responsibilities, of course, is standard office operating procedure in any organization, as we all know.

Anyhow, going to work on Monday is, as they say, the pits, yes.  But, there are some ways to alleviate the sheer misery.  For instance, for a little office fun and "good natured humor", it can be amusing for all (more or less...) to play some harmless shenanigan from time to time.  You know, to keep the morale up.

...Ahem...

1) Mystery-Coffee-O-Fun

My brother, straight out of the Marine Corps., taught me this one.  If you're an office drone like many of us yups out there, chances are you have direct access to a coffee machine of some sort (in the military, coffee is water).  Such being the case, it can be loads of fun to put some fun "mystery" ingredients into the coffee machine prior to pressing the "on" switch.
a.  My brother started the fun by inserting the majority of a can of seasoned salt into the coffee machine.  Ho ho .. the good times.
b.  Several days later, it was found in the machine at the end of the day, upon cleaning the filter, and subsequent to people using it all day, a complete pair of soiled underpants.
c.  The retaliation was quick, when my brother inserted a "little of everything" into the machine, which included everything he could find from pencil shavings to shredded paper.  Fortunately, nobody died.  They finally had to stop the whole thing before somebody broke out the rat poison.

2) Mature Humor Solutions

I remember back to my freshman year of high school, my friend and I conspired to drive our history teacher nuts, and we did so successfully by making use of a few simple and inexpensive tools.  Namely, we purchased one of those electronic, remote-controlled whoopee cushions.  It's an excellent contraption wherein the battery-controlled "whoopee cushion" speaker can be strategically placed anywhere in a given room or office, and the operator need only press a button to activate it on command.

Of course, when I was a freshman in high school, strategic electronic whoopee cushion placement was not a forte of mine.  We placed it inside his desk in the corner of the room, and periodically during his lecture, we set it off.  This caused him great annoyance, but the effect was not nearly as severe as we had hoped due to the remote placement of the device.  The timing, however, was immaculate.

"As we can see, the Prussian involvement in European macro-history had great effects upon the aspects of---"

"BWOOOAAAAMMP"

"--aspects of--"

"BWOOOOAAAMMP"

"--asp-0"

"BWOOOAAAMMP"

"--for God sakes, who keeps doing that?!!?"

One of my classmates, Jessica, could have sworn there was a duck trapped in the wall, and she kept petitioning the instructor to let her try to find it so she could save it.  The fun just never stopped.

I figure that, given a little strategic placement and planning, one of these devices could add that extra life to any corporate meeting.

3) (Fun) Office Sabotage

What the big boss or your esteemed co-worker really needs on Monday morning is a real pick-me-up.  You know, a jump start to get the week going.  What could be better than a little innocent office prank carefully placed to boost that morale?  Here are a few ideas for starters:

a)  Place something grossly large on his or her desk.  This can be just about anything from the remotely sane (<i>War and Peace</i>) to the ridiculous (a fourteen-pound block of lard).  One suggestion is to buy several hundred pieces of bubble gum and mush them together into one giant bubble gum ball.  This works great for shock effect.

b)  An idea that I got from the <a href="http://www.theolympian.com/home/news/20040107/southsound/8191.shtml">Internet</a> involves carefully wrapping everything on a person's desk (or in his or her office) in aluminum foil, which can be tedious, but fun.  Imagine how impressed your coworkers will be at your dedication, patience, and cunning.  This prank may even land you a promotion.

c)  Dixie cups are not just good for office parties; they also make great gags.  If done correctly, physics dictates that several cups full of Kool-Aid can be placed upside down on a desk by using a sheet of paper and some quick reflexes.  You can also staple several hundred cups together, fill them with Kool Aid, or some other dubious liquid, and place them in an esteemed co-worker's cubicle and/or office on the floor, thereby inhibiting that person's ability to get to his or her desk.  The fun they will have!

There are, of course, many, many others.  However, due to the fact that I have now met today's quota of nefariously wasting at least one hour of work per day (yesterday I flung rubber bands at my coworkers to meet the quota), I must now do something that remotely resembles productivity (such as staring at my desk).

Hopefully this weblog will never fall into the hands of my superiors at work.
