If that old proverb is true, I am in definite trouble.  Very, very big trouble, because, technically, using the concise logic of "you are what you eat", I am a bean burrito.

Actually, that's not quite true.  I am more of a cross-breed between a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger, a burrito, and several donuts.  I am on the "I only have five minutes to get food before I have to _______!!" diet, which means I have to eat whatever is closest to me at any particular given time.
This has been the cause of some very interesting side-effects.  I spent a good 20 minutes staring at my desk this morning at work, attempting to make it change colors with my brain.  Eventually, I popped out of this catatonic state, got up, and promptly ran into the door--face first.  Then, in an attempt to get coffee, I poured scalding hot water into a cup and drank it, burning my tongue.  Apparently, you have to put ground up coffee beans in the coffee maker to get it to work right, or something like that.

So, now that the weekend is coming, I have made a vow to eat something better, which shouldn't be that difficult; I mean, let's face it.. beef jerky on a stick would be more healthy than what I've been living off of.  We shall see where that goes.

In the meantime, however, I'm thinking of stopping by the taco store and picking up a bean burrito on my way home, then maybe getting some donuts -- you know, for consistency's sake.
