...is a direct result of choices that I make in the present.  For example, the last two days I have decided to fore go the taking of any showers, changing of underwear, eating of any substenance besides Ramen and vitamins, and the concept of sleep.  Instead, I have been buried in a gray book entitled "How to Prepare for the GRE".  The first preparation tip is not to wait until the week <i>of</i> the Graduate Record Examination to buy the book.  Dang.

Anyhow, today was the big day.  Unshaven and still toting my GRE book around as if it were surgically attached to my arm, I awoke at seven this morning changed jeans, and proceeded out the door.  I went to my eight o'clock class and spent about five minutes showing somebody how to do some things with Linux; I spent the rest of the time trying to memorize the formula for the area of a circle ( A = 2 * pi * r(2)), which is something that I stored in the back vault of my memory along with all of those grade-A pick-up lines after high school (if only I could get a book at Borders that would help me remember <i>those!</i>).

Then I took a mid-term.  Then I got breakfast.  Then I got lost.  Then I showed up at the testing center fifteen minutes late.  Then I used the bathroom.  Then I took the GRE.

Let me tell you, that is the most exhausting test I've ever taken!  It lasted three hours, and in terms of having enough time to work things out, the whole test felt like five minutes.  In terms of looking back on it in retrospect, it seemed like twelve hours.  Some guy kept walking in to make sure I wasn't reading "Schaumm's Guide to the Answers on the GRE" or something while taking the test, too.  But, all in all, I did pretty good thus far.  I don't think I set any records, but I sure didn't bomb it, either.  One thing is for sure, my scores are more than adequate enough for me to get enrolled into the graduate program of my choice - IS @ FSU.

So, anyhow, that was pretty much the last step in my application process that I haven't yet completed.  I turn my supplemental admission application and my assistanceship application in tomorrow.  Then, well, the ball is in their court.  Let's hope the process happens quickly.  In any case, here's to graduate school and to the future!
