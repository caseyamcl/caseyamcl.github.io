Apparently, I'm leaving Tallahassee and moving in a northerly direction towards who-knows-where at which point I will somehow eventually encounter two fireplaces, two large rodents (one who is sports-inclined), and some fish.

I am also getting married in approximately twelve months to gourment coffee bars, or something like that.
