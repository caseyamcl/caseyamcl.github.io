<strong>Running Update</strong>

Tonight was the most difficult run of my life.  Last night, I only recieved four hours of sleep, so I was a little delerious all day.  When Keri and I decided that eight miles was the goal, I first thought that it would be no problem.

Then, mile two-and-a-half crept up on me, and I realized that I had not had enough water today.  My dizziness was a sign of dehydration.  We kept going anyway.

My legs started to protest around mile three, especially my left knee.  It was as if I hadn't worked out in ages.

My stomach started to cramp up around mile four-and-a-half.  I was letting out atrocious burps throughout the run.  They didn't make me feel any better.

Around lap fourteen, I started to lose faith that I would actually make it 32 times around the track.  I figured that I would go as far as I could reasonably make it, and then I would just throw the towel in.  Then, I realized that Keri was in about as much physical agony as I was.  She was feeling it, too.

So, we kept on saying really simple things like, "Come on.. we can do this", and "can't stop now - almost halfway".  We just kept on going -- no stopping.

Lap 16 rolled around and I knew that we had 16 more laps to go.  Halfway seemed to be barely any accomplishment at all, considering what was still ahead.

When we got to twenty-two, my legs had all but given out, and I really believe it was will power and divine intervention alone that kept me moving.  I felt nothing but the overwhelming desire to simply stop and sit down.  But, with one foot in front of the other, both of us continued to run.

Lap twenty-three...

Twenty Four...

Twenty Five... Each lap more painful than the last.

Then, as we came up on 31, Keri decided to pull ahead and just take off, leaving me back behind her.  I was in too much pain to compete, but with only two laps to go, I couldn't let anything stop me.

As lap 32 came around, something seized me, and I decided that since this was the last lap of an extremely incredible run, and in the amazement that we had actually made it this far considering all the odds, I just took off and used every bit of energy that I had left.

I am proud to say that I sprinted that last lap.  Keri and I finished about the same time, with me ahead by a few feet.  It just goes to show you how much is in the mind.  If I can make it eight miles under such excrutiating circumstances, my job doesn't seem so daunting after all.  Class -- not a problem.  Personal issues -- what personal issues?  No mountain seems too difficult to climb.

Next week: Nine miles.
