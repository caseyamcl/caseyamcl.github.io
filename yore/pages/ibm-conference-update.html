title: 'IBM Conference Update'

My website is back from vacation.  In fact, apparently it was kicked out of some bar in Bimini for what I am told can only be described as, "lewd, obnoxious behavior" and "inappropriate and unethical mannerisms".  Well, that's all good and well, because I haven't had a chance to update this site until today anyhow.

And I barely have a chance now.  I am sitting with my laptop on the floor between the women's restroom door and a water fountain next to the only power outlet in the terminal at Orlando International Airport.  That infernal drinking machine keeps spewing water all over me whenever anybody comes and gets a drink.  It must be stopped, and I have to stop it.

Ahem.. Another amusing anecdote is that there is a lady here also using a laptop.  She came up to me and asked me for permission to also plug into the lone power outlet.  I guess the power outlet has been perceived as being in my territory now.  Only I grant access to it.  I should charge money.

Since I last updated, I've been all over the north half of the State of Florida at least once or twice now.  So, things have been busy.  This week, it has been the IBM Higher Education Conference in Epcot.  ...quite an experience, I must say.  The College that I work for decided that it would be a great idea for the Administrative Dean of the Department and myself to head to Orlando and see what IBM wants to sell us this year.  At first, I thought that the trip was intended to be serious, dignified, and perhaps even professional.  I had no idea that it was actually a comedy routine.

From the start, we had our share of interesting amusements.  The first involved navigating Walt Disney Worldâs many, many roads.  The corporate entertainment giant has really brought to life Walt Disney's vision of designing a roadway system more complex than the circuit boards on the space shuttle.  The dean and I got lost no less than three times on the way to our resort.

But, after an extra two hours, we eventually found the resort, spent a few geological eras checking in and getting our rooms, and then got lost again driving around the resort parking lot, which is larger than some small countries.  Eventually, we found our rooms.  So the quest turned from finding where we were supposed to go to the task of finding sustenance.  This should not have been too difficult at Walt Disney World, only the world's largest resort/vacation destination.  It turned out like a search for food in the gutters of the Jewish Ghettos of World War II.

We hopped a bus to Downtown Disney Marketplace, which has many restaurants.  For each dining venue, however, there were at least eight million people waiting to get in.  The waits at most of the restaurants were over two and a half hours to even get a table.  And people were waiting!  I liken the eating experience at Disney to standing in line for food at a Russian Gulag.  We decided that actually <i>eating</i> food was more important than waiting hours to have some teenager in a Goofy costume serve us food, so we headed back to the hotel on the bus.  You can imagine the feeling we experienced upon arriving back at the hotel after riding the bus for 30 minutes only to find that we had made a giant circle, and our hotel was actually right across the street from Downtown Disney.

But, things ended up okay.  We were back at our overpriced resort, so we were sure to get food.  We did in fact get a table after only fifteen minutes at a restaurant called "The Outback", which was good.  The bad part was that we must have promptly become invisible after sitting down, because nobody acknowledged our presence for a good half hour.   This made the good dean a little upset, so he went up and said something to the manager.  Iâm not sure what it was, but it probably went something like, "If you donât feed me right now, I will blow this place to dust with the bombs that I have hidden in my shoes."  As soon as he came back to the table, every single employee of the restaurant, and possibly some employees of other restaurants in the area, was at the table offering us free drinks, free meals, free desserts, free piggyback rides, keys to their cars, and everything else imaginable.  I can't say the meal was bad at all, even though I was hungry enough to eat raw livestock by then.

But the real fun began the next morning, the day of the great and mighty IBM Conference.  So, we awoke real early, got in the car, and promptly got lost as soon as we left the hotel parking lot.  Eventually, however, we found Epcot (note to self: look for the giant golf ball), and found the IBM people standing at the entrance.  We were able to find them real easily given the clear and easy-to-read instructions on our agenda briefs: "Look for the fat, balding, introverted, fashion-alert, middle aged guys that have the aura of being lost and scared of the sun about them."

After that, this guy who works at Epcot herded us together and led us through the park to a building called "Body Works", which I think is completely appropriate for a computer conference.  In this building are a lot of exhibits explaining what colons and spleens are.  Thatâs my kind of vacation adventure.  In any case, we didnât pay too much attention to the biology stuff, but instead got ushered back down these tiny corridors into what looked like the janitor closet.  It turned out to be a secret elevator which took us up to the conference room overlooking the "Body Works" exhibit, allowing all of the geeks to spy on all of the tourists.

After filling up on free donuts, we were then ushered into a small conference room.  Thatâs when the presentations began.  I wonât bore the reader any more by describing in mind-numbing detail all of the endless presentations (a.k.a. IBM sales pitches), but some of it was downright great.  I donât consider myself a great humorist, but the IBM conference provided me with so much material, I can't help but share it.

The first presenter was kind of funny.  He kept on using phrases like "proactive approach", "dynamic solutions", and "Dell sucks" pretty liberally.  He can also be quoted as saying that, "the days of pen and paper are over," and, "technology is ON THE MARCH."  Then the computer he was using to present crashed.  Yes, technology is indeed on the march; that is, in the form of IBM salespeople knocking on the doors of businesses as adamantly as Jehovah's Witnesses begging you to buy their computers.

Not to say I didnât enjoy the conference; on the contrary, I enjoyed it immensely.  I discovered all kinds of new, meaningless corporate lingo I can sling around freely to fill up dead space during meetings at work.  Plus, I learned about <a href="http://www.cantenna.com">Cantenna</a>, which may very well be the coolest thing ever.  Apparently, using a Pringles can, some PVC pipe, a few copper wires, and a metal rod, you can create an 802.11b antenna that can pick up a wireless Internet signal up to six miles from the source.  Cantenna is, naturally, a company run by college students.  For better reception, you can always upgrade to a beef stew can or, if youâre feeling bold, a full-sized metal garbage can.

What I really learned at the conference, though, is that IBM is the only good company and that everybody else is bad.  No, I am just kidding.  They did not get to me at all, and I feel perfectly rationale in my decision making abili-musT BUY IBM.  MUST PURCHASE IBM.  IBM IS GOOD.  IBM IS PERFECT.  IBM IS MY LEADER.  I WILL DO WHAT IBM SAYS- Whoa.. ahem.

Anyhow, the conference dragged on for a few days, and when I wasn't sitting in some board room somewhere listening to IBM's chip-cooling techniques, I was sitting in some restaurant with the IBM sales representative eating dinner and listening to stories about his television watching habits.  Actually, I was sitting with about five guys, twice my age, who enjoyed drinking beer and talking about sports.  The conversation went from basketball to baseball to football to basketball to baseball to football to somebodyâs kids to baseball to football to- ...you get the idea.

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, though, and had good food, stayed in a hotel where they left little mints on the pillow, and had the opportunity to meet all kinds of important IBM sales representatives who know all about how IBM is better than everybody else.

You donât need organized religion if you have IBM.
