This blog has been ressurected from the dead, kind of like "The Night of the Living Dead", only without the flesh-obsessed zombies and Judith O'Dea.  So, what happened?  Well, besides the fact that I've been to Monterey, Las Vegas, Orlando, and very briefly, Denver, Los Angelos, and San Fransisco, I have been kind of "busy".  Christmas came and brought with it the responsibility to meet with people, some of whom I had forgotten existed (just kidding -- mostly; sorry Mike); several trips on many airplanes where I met, and attempted to avoid (although it's rather difficult in a 300-foot long tube 30,000 feet in the sky), many more interesting people; some very competitive games of monopoly (which I won--haha); a $9,000 telescope; a pending trip to Europe; and a new computer (some assembly required).
Overall, 2003 has thus past, and now it's time to sludge--err, I mean--through 2004, which ought to be interesting considering all of the things I've decided to do, consisting of school, job 1, job 2, job 3, and tutoring.  Needless to say, the School of Information Studies at Florida State University now officially owns me.  I think that I have this sign stamped to my forehead that says "Free - Slave Labor - For Use as Grunt in Acedamia" that only I can't see.  Either way, it ought to be interesting.

Okay, so this post is just to let all four of you faithful readers out there know that I am still alive, this website is very much still alive, and now I have to go again -- but not for as long -- hopefully.  So I'm going to go.
