<style type="text/css"> .censored { background-color: black; color: white; } </style>  <strong>Should We <span class="censored">Censored</span> the web?</strong>

No.  We should not <span class="censored">Censored</span> the Internet, or any literature in my <span class="censored">Censored</span> opinion.  We should be allowed to express our <span class="censored">Censored</span> views freely.

This is why I <span class="censored">Censored</span> all literature, and it is worth reading.  After all, it's <span class="censored">Censored</span> like music.  To say that you can't listen to certain types of music is very, very <span class="censored">Censored</span> and asenine.  It is taking personal, god-given <span class="censored">Censored</span> freedoms away.

Now, I'm not saying that three-year-olds should be reading stuff like <span class="censored">Censored</span> or <span class="censored">Censored</span>; and definitely not <span class="censored">Censored</span>!  But, society really needs ot be reasonable.

People write <span class="censored">Censored</span> to share ideas and to <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> is to completely defy the point of writing in the <span class="censored">Censored</span>, as is fairly obvious.  The <span class="censored">Censored</span> people who are banning literature from libraries and implementing public filters on the <span class="censored">Censored</span> Internet are not doing the community a favor.  The <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> and <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> is <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> so <span class="censored">Censored</span>, as <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>.

Furthermore, <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>.

With all that said, <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> chicken <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> doorknobs <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> should be <span class="censored">Censored</span> with a <span class="censored">Censored</span> iguanas and <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>, yes.

In conclusion, <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>, so don't <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>.

That is my <span class="censored">Censored</span> <span class="censored">Censored</span>.  Thank you for your <span class="censored">Censored</span>.
