Welcome to devca.net (Developed by Casey), Version 4!  This one was code-named "Longhorn-Steakhouse" for a while, but I had to scrap the name and roll it out early after Microsoft and some restaurant chain came after me with a herd of lawyers.  Hence the little <img alt="No!" style="display: inline" src="http://devca.net/global/images/icon_no.gif" /> images over there on the Navigation bar.

Anyhow, this site is my latest effort at good design and has quite a few new elements, bringing it into the 21st century of design practices.  In developing the new site, I searched around a while for some content management systems that would suit me, and I <em>almost</em> went with Movable Type, but decided Blogger would be a better bet for now as long as Google doesn't try anything sneaky with the service.

Works in progress include the Features Section, which will include (gasp) substantial content, and a few other items.  In the meantime, cheers, and yes, I know... I'll stop re-designing the site as soon as I find something better to do at work --err, I mean, on my time at home <em>away</em> from work, definitely off the clock. Heh heh...
