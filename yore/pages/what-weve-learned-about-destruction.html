According to history, we have come a long way in the past several hundred years.

In fact, one can consider him or herself fairly fortunate to be living in such times as we are now.  It is, after all, just after the turn of the third millennium of the A.D. era, and it is often astounding how many things, as a species, we actually possess knowledge of.  Walk into any library, and take a long look at the rows upon rows of endless literature of all types and consider that you are looking merely at a tiny fraction of all documented human knowledge.  Our inquisitive nature has truly inspired us to create a lot of speculation about the world around us, resulting in the accumulation of trillions upon trillions (literally exabytes) of information, nowadays accessible to anybody in the civilized world curious or ambitious enough to seek it.

The practical implications have been astounding.  Three hundred years ago--barely an inkling in the overall history of our species--medical doctors may have decided that the best way of curing your blood clot would be by attaching leeches to your skin; nowadays, we use more enlightened techniques.  Thanks to scientific speculations such as wave theory, which eventually developed into transmission technology, we have radio, television, and the Internet, which you are undoubtedly making use of right at this very moment, allowing for instantaneous communication and publishing.  A careful combination of chemistry, physics, daring, and good fortune allows us to shoot electronic devices into the sky and out into space, and our knowledge of gravity allows us to keep them close enough to use to talk to people in Japan.
The implications of knowledge go far beyond the mediocrity of day-to-day use (that is, if that's how you would like to think of it), and stretch into realms that even the imagination has often not delved into.  We can, based upon the reputable calculations of mathematics, put an age on the planet that we inhabit and estimate to a reasonable degree the age of the universe itself.  We can analyze what exists thousands of kilometers below us and millions of kilometers above our heads.  We can state with certainty what happens when elements thousands of times smaller than the human threshold of vision can discern collide with each other.  We can measure the unseen around us, peer off into the unknown far away from us, and even look within ourselves (speaking both metaphorically and literally).

Yet, such knowledge has produced a torrent of new realizations about the universe around us, and every new insight, both personally and collectively, eradicates another bit of innocence that has undertoned our culture as a whole.  The most complacent person in the world must feel a little uneasy for at least a second or two upon realizing the potential for--say, a meteor hitting the earth.  To digress a little on that particular point...

As most of us were taught in elementary school (except those of us from Georgia, of course) that there exists between Mars and Jupiter a "belt" of asteroids, which, thanks in part to the overwhelming gravitational pull of Jupiter, never quite formed into a planet.  Instead, they consist of thousands upon thousands (millions, perhaps?) of rocks orbiting the sun.  I fail to use the phrase 'locked in orbit', because they are anything but.  Any slight anomaly out there could send one of them careening of its usual orbital path and into, well for the sake of example, earth's orbit.  Now, even still, the odds are in our favor in terms of avoiding collision.  Not only would the asteroid have to travel directly into earth's orbit, it would have to cross that orbit at the exact moment that the earth, which is traveling at 107,000 km per hour, crosses into <i>its</i> path.  This is good news for us, considering the devastation that would occur if one of these things were big enough.

The heat generated by the impact would nearly instantaneously wipe out an area the size of over half of the United States.  It would, in a matter of seconds, send a shockwave of energy across the horizon for thousands of kilometers, obliterating everything its path.  However, the worst part of the impact would be the millions upon millions of tons of ash it would send up into the atmosphere, literally covering the planet in a cloud so thick that it would all but wipe out most life on the planet, especially humans, considering our physical fragility and conspicuous habitat.

The bad news is three-fold.  First, there is little we can do to predict such a collision. Scientists would have to know exactly where to be looking in the sky.  They would, speaking in terms of analogy, be looking for a fruit-fly in an ocean.  A blast from a meteor of almost any proportion would most likely come careening out of the sky in an instant.  It could happen at any second.  Secondly, even if we were to locate the doomsday meteor, there would be little we could do about it.  It's not as if we could slow earth's revolution or, for that matter, steer the meteor off its path.  A nuclear demolition of the rock would most likely just break it up into smaller, equally lethal fragments.  Finally, it is not as if a death-meteor hasn't impacted earth before.  Some scientists think space rocks killed the dinosaurs.  There are several impact craters in existence, as well.

But, I am off on a tangent.  My point was that now that we are aware of all of the many ways that society could be eradicated, it kind of puts one on edge.

And, as if there weren't enough dangers out there already, we have developed sciences of destroying ourselves maybe not as efficiently as asteroids, but unquestionably just as effectively.  Atomic theory has been the source of some of our most ingenious power producing devices and some of our most destructive inventions.  Some of my doomsday-minded friends are quick to point out that Russia has now developed nuclear weapons the size of a tennis ball.  Great..

As if we didn't have enough to stress over.  But, really, unless a meteor hits earth, the ice caps melt, Yellowstone explodes, the ultimate plague breaks out, nuclear holocaust happens, the sun explodes, aliens invade, or some scientists in Britain, while building giant proton accelerators, inadvertently create a black hole, we're going to be around for a little while longer.

It's a fragile place we live, and it seems the more we learn about it, the less stable our environment becomes.  Such is the nature of knowledge.  In the same fashion that the e-mail took a lot of the sophistication and romance out of writing letters and the invention of the airplane subdued our wonderment and astonishment with the sky (especially when you're crammed next to some big snoring guy on a five-hour haul to California), discovery is two-fold; it is a double-edged sword.  Sure, we learn things about the world and develop new perspectives, but we also lose some innocence.

Alas, it is in our nature to discover, develop, and dwell upon; three virtues that make us human.  Aren't these the same reasons that I am writing and publishing this article, and perhaps the same reasons you are reading it?  It represents in small part, the greatest and most noble of all human undertakings: the quest for knowledge.

...And, despite startling revelations, we have, thus far, indeed come a long way.
