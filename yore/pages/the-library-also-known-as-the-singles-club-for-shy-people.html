College libraries have been around forever. These scholastic and academic institutions have been facilitating the needs of the higher-education populace for centuries. Those needs primarily consist of attempting to get others to notice you while, at the same time, attempting to be deeply involved in some very important and scholarly research-oriented endeavors.

Of course, this situation mirrors the general situation around campus when it comes to attempting to get noticed by the opposite gender. Those of us who have played this game in the past can thank Methuselah that we don't worry about this kind of superficial charade anymore (to which I add, "YEAH RIGHT!"). Basically, the routine consists of the following:
<ul>
	<li>Attempt to get noticed.</li>
	<li>Pretend the last thing that you actually want is to get noticed.</li>
</ul>
This is what results in the 1.0039 second length glances that people of opposite genders give each other around campus as they walk at ninety-six miles per hour towards their respective destinations (United Nations Summits, maybe?). More often than not, these quick fleeting looks really mean, "I am attracted to you. Stop and talk to me!" Of course, nobody ever stops and talks to anybody. It is part of the game wherein nobody can actually admit that they have any desire to speak with anyone else in the entire world, especially if that certain "anyone else" may possibly have the notion that you possibly find her or him attractive.

So, yes, this charade basically happens everywhere, but especially on subway trains, at workplaces, and most definitely on college campuses. What makes the library such an amusing playground for this kind of behavior is the fact that the entire environment is more or less silent. So, the whole too-busy-to-talk-to-you-even-though-that's-what-I'm-really-here-for pretense is performed in a mime-like atmosphere. This can provide hours of amusing distraction for those hoping to observe this behavior from a third-party perspective (good for a Sunday afternoon, perhaps); however, it's mind-numbingly frustrating for those involved (kind of like watching ducks fight each other for bread crumbs).

I don't want to over-generalize here (even though that's my favorite thing to do on this website). Some people come to the library to actually work. Namely, those people can be classified as: girls. Everyone else goes to the library because they want to seem smart and get noticed in an atmosphere of pseudo-intellectualism. So, how does this whole college pastime take place? Consider an example:

We have "studying" at table A, Slightly Shy and Not Admittedly Lonely College Junior Guy, named John. At table B, exactly four tables down, but within direct line of vision from John, is Sheila, who actually <em>is</em> studying. Most of John's two-and-a-half hours of studying consist of awkward glances and a series of brain waves that can be depicted as follows:

John's Brain (quickly stealing a look at Sheila for the 39,309 time): "Oh man. Look! There's Sheila! ... Oh jeez, she just glanced up at me! Quick, look back down at my book! I have to pretend I'm working! Oh man, I hope she didnât see me looking at her."

John's Brain (about two and a half seconds later): "Oh man! Look! There's Sheila! ... Dude, she's getting up? Where is she going??!!!? No!! Where did Sheila go!?!?!!?! ... Hey, her books are still there! Did SHE FORGET HER BOOKS?!! SHE FORGOT HER BOOKS! SCORE!! I'llâOh wait, she's just getting a drink. She's sitting down again! Oh my god, she just glanced at me! Quick, look back down at my book! I have to pretend I'm studying... etc."

ohn's Brain (about two and a half seconds later: "Oh man! Look! There's Sheila! ... I'd better look at my book in case she looks at me. That way I'll look like I'm actually trying to learn something! I'm looking at my book... looking at my book... I really want to look up, but I shouldn't! That would imply Iâm desperate, and John is definitely NOT desperate! ... ... I wonder if she's looking at me."

--Sheila packs up and departs the library--

Johnâs Brain: "Oh man! Look! There's â HEY! Whereâd Sheila go?! Oh man, this sucks. Now what am I going to do? I wonder if she noticed me. Maybe I should go outside and follow her. Maybe she'll talk to me! I don't want to be in the library... what am I doing in here, for, anyhow? Sheila's gone. Now thereâs nothing to do!"

--Another girl comes in sits down at Table C--

Johnâs Brain: "Oh man!  Look!  There's Mary!..."

...and so on and so forth...

The question is, why does this occur? I think itâs a genetic defect handed down by Adam (you know, the #1 man way back in Eden) through all generations of my fellow men. I call it the "desperation" gene. It's been the cause of incredible amounts wasted productivity in the history of human beings, not to mention a lot of angst. Just take into consideration the Cold War, the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the entire Middle East (they can't even <em>look</em> at women over there; no wonder they're so angry!), just to mention a few. Of course, most of these things occurred, as my girlfriend Helen would put it, before the creation of cable television, wherein guys from any background and of any psychological profile can now sit and pretend to be noticed by women on "MTV Jams", something my roommate very much enjoys watching (and I'm sure he is not alone).

Speaking of libraries, I cannot continue any longer with this post, because I'm at the library, and I really have to stop wasting time now. I'm supposed to be getting some very pertinent work done for my Information Sci-Oh man! Look, there's Carrie! Oh man...
