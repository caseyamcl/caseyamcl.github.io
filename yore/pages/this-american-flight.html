Greetings from a bench at Gate 35, or is 65... or is it 44?  Who knows... It becomes difficult to tell after a while.  I am sitting here in Washington, or is it Pittsburgh, or is it Jacksonville?  Ah, the city or state I'm in really doesn't matter either, I suppose.  They all look pretty much the same from my view.  I sense the world now only as a thickish haze, permeating with various shapes and sounds; here a Starbucks, there a payphone.  After 24 consecutive hours of airport, the entire world becomes background noise...there is no focusing on anything.  I have found that my entire esteem hinges on the availablity of wireless network service at whatever location I happen to have just arrived at.  I certainly don't stay in one place long...

It all started yesterday, innocently enough, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  After a busy, but productive and fun weekend with my sister, the time had come for me to make the trip back across the states to Florida paying a visit to no less than four airports along the way, which is--let's face it--the way we Americans like to do mass transit these days.  I had chosen this route, though, and decided that I would indeed make the 12 hour journey, surviving off of only Hudson News and Starbucks, the way that adventurists survive off of trail mix and whatever they catch at the hunt in the wilderness.  It was to be an impressive display of precision timing and split-second execution, connecting to no less than three airplanes with only moments between the flights (Yahoo travel really knows how to make you run).  Having eaten well at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning and performed my pre-flight calisthenics, I was up for the challenge.

Probably the first sign that nothing was about to go right was me losing my boarding pass at the bookstore in the Denver International Airport.  This is never fun, because after you lose a boarding pass in America in the 21st century, getting it back can be likened to retrieving Apollo 13.  I did find it, though, and was on my way to Pittsburgh within moments.

Okay, just kidding.  First, I had to get through security, which involves a careful striptease show: remove belt, remove shoes, remove watch, remove jacket, remove laptop, remove whatever else ... step through scary looking machine ... replace watch, replace jacket, replace shoes, replace belt, forget everything else, etc.  This takes time, but I was not worried; I was on my game.  Even when I discovered the plane was 15 minutes delayed, this did not bother me.  All was well.

So, I got on the plane with everyone else, and then we sat on the runway... and sat, and sat, and just ast there.  Occasionally, the pilot would cheer us up with some great news of our progress of getting out of the airport: "We're 13 for departure"... "We're 11 for departure"... "We're 9 for departure"... "Whoops, we've slipped back down to 15 for departure!"  After Hell froze over and the pigs on the runway in front of us took off, I felt something funny  It was the plane lifting off into the air.  The row I was sitting in was beginning to take bets as to whether or not this was possible.  Unfortunately, we were so late that I was going to miss my connection from Pittsburgh to Washington, but... such is life.

It was the worst-case scenario, and I was already there, so nothing to worry about except getting out of it: I would arrive in Jacksonville at some obscene hour of the morning, drink a lot of expresso, and I'd be good to drive the three hours back to Tallahassee.  Again, such is life.

Pittsburgh was nice, except they gave me the news upon arriving (at 6:00 p.m.) that the next flight to Washington was not until 9:00 p.m., and that the next flight to Jacksonville from Washington wasn't until 8:00 a.m. the next morning!  No, there was no way to reroute the trip; no there were no other USAir flights from anywhere in the world to Jacksonville that night; no, they couldn't really help me except put me on those later flights.

Arg... New worst case scenario:  I would arrive in Tallahassee mid-day on Tuesday, missing all of my appointments and meetings that morning; I would spend Monday night trying to use my laptop as a pillow while sleeping on a bench in the dreaded Reagan National Airport; I would suck it up majorly and deal with the situation.  So, I got on the plane in Pittsburgh, and we sat on the runway.. and we sat, and sat, and sat.  This pilot was equally cheerful as the last: "Folks, we got some weather in Washington and they've grounded all planes headed there; the good news is that they expect the storm to pass sometime soon."  I occupied myself by reading the "Skymall" catalog, something I had vowed to never do, but hunger and exhaustion were driving me to it.

We ended up in chilly Washington D.C. around 11:45 p.m., which I thought really wouldn't make a difference, since I still had 8 hours to wait anyhow.  So, I stuck to plan "C" or "D" or whatever it was, found a bench and seated myself, until I was abruptly ushered out of the aiport 5 minutes after arriving.

Security guy on intercom: "Ronald Reagan National Airport is now closing for the night.  If you are not boarding the flight to New Orleans, please vacate the premises at this time.  We will re-open at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow morning".  Aw, nuts...

So, I got $20 from the ATM, went outside the airport, and joined the line of approximately 100 evicted persons waiting for a cab.

New worst case scenario:  I'm stuck on the street in Washington DC, standing in cab line not knowing what I'll do when I get to the front, with nowhere to stay, on a cold night in a light sweater, and I'm really needing a hamburger or something.

So, I coordinated over my dying cell phone with Anna back in Tallahassee to try to find some place on the Internet that would shelter me for 7 hours.  She read off the names of places:  Holiday Inn ($150), Radisson ($200), Crown Royal ($Left Arm), Ritz Carlton ($First Born Son), Dunley Corporate Center Resort ($Your Soul + Lots of money)...

I considered just riding the Metro train all night, but, unfortunately, it was cold outside.

So, I waited in the taxi line, figuring I'd find a way to wing it, or just live inside the taxi guy's trunk for a night.  I could slip him a ten, and he could give me a magazine to read back there.  Upon getting to the front of the line and into the cab, I spoke to the driver, soon to discover that he knew three phrases in English: "Yes", "No", and "No Credit Card".

Me: "700 North Washington - The Travelodge, if it still exists."

Him: "No, yes" (and then he sped off).

Me: "Do you know how far it is from here?"

Him: "No credit card."

Me: "Ok."

We traveled forty feet from the airport before stopping behind a broken-down car on the entrance ramp to the parkway. Then we sat for a while watching the police man take care of the problem by placing lighted flares around the car, just in case the people entering the parkway became confused and couldn't realize that there was a car sitting in front of them on the on-ramp.  Adding little sticks of flaming gas onto a busy road is always good, safe policy to practice in a major metropolitan area, is it not?

After the taxi-cab meter went up about $8.00 watching the drama, we sped off again to the Travelodge in Alexandria, which thankfully still exists, although not in its original state of cleanliness.  I got out of the cab as it was speeding out of the parking lot (I think that in whatever language the cab driver spoke, "please wait a few minutes" really means, "please drive away as fast as possible once I step out of the cab")  The lady in the hotel lobby politely informed me that, "we ain't got none rooms right naw".  I resolved to sleep under a bush somewhere, or perhaps in one of Washington's many dumpsters.

Fortunately, she somehow, miraculously found a room for $98.00, so I paid up and thirty minutes later, she finished processing the order.  The room was, well, it was a room.  The key features included a phone that wasn't plugged in to anything (decoration, perhaps?), paint peeling from the toilet seat, and my favorite, a two-to-three inch insect with at least 32 legs.  It looked like a giant mutant grasshopper, and if it hadn't been crawling on the bed, I might have been more fascinated by it.  I had never seen anything like it before, and in retrospect, I kind of feel bad about stomping it to death with my foot.

The rest of the night was spent sitting on the bed watching Fox News, trying not to fall asleep, knowing that I would never wake up again.  I didn't want to get too comfortable, which wasn't a big problem since I had checked my main bag way back in Colorado, and it was now currently in some undisclosed location within the 48 states (along with my toothbrush, razor, phone charger, and clothes).  Eventually, dosing off was inevitable, though, and I slept like a rock for 2 1/2 hours.

I awoke at 5:45 a.m. this morning and was picked up by what I believe was Osama Bin Laden's cousin, driving a yellow-cab, and I'm back in my favorite place ever: Ronald Reagan National Airport.  Will I get home today?  Only if I have no more sins to pay for, methinks.  I'm about to go get my daily morsel of food, so I'd better end this on a positive note of hope.  So, here it goes: I hope that I get home today safely; I hope my desk at work isn't overflowing with stuff to do from my absence; I hope that I find my luggage safe and sound in Jacksonville; and, I hope that I think more carefully about perhaps taking the train next time instead of flying.

Ah, well.  Cheers for the moment.

<strong>Epilogue:</strong>

I did indeed (a) make it home safely, although much later than originally thought, (b) catch up on work without losing too much sleep, (c) find my luggage, and (d) will sacrafice a lamb, cow, human blood, or whatever I need to for the Great God of Airline Travel -- or perhaps get a horse.

A few post-travel facts for all you soon-to-travel out there (from a seasoned airport veteran):
<ul>
	<li>Denver International Airport has a great French Restaurant in the main terminal.</li>
	<li>Pittsburgh probably has the best free wireless connection in the country, although Jacksonville is working on theirs.</li>
	<li>Washington Reagan is indeed a slummy airport, and don't eat at Jimmy's whatever you do.</li>
	<li>It's a good idea, always to carry your toothbrush on the plane with you.. you never know where you'll end up.  Also, it is absolutely essential to carry a towel everywhere you go.  For more information, see the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (which is equally relevant to hitching a plane ride in America).</li>
