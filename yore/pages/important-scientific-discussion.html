I have recently been reading about conspiracy theories on the Internet.  The one that strikes me as the most fascinating is the alleged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_hoax">moon landing hoax theory</a>, which supports the notion that we never landed on the moon.

To this I say...

<b><em>Of course we went to the moon.</b></em>  But, not until the 1990's after Al Gore invented the space shuttle.

Many will say that the moon landing would have been impossible, given the distance from the Earth to the moon.

As it turns out, however, the distance was greatly overestimated due to the Van Allen magnifying glass that hovers between the two lunar bodies (see official NASA imagary below).

</a>Astronauts were able to make it past the magnifying glass by drilling through it with the horn from a unicorn.

...ahem...

In conclusion, I hope that we've laid this little matter to rest once and for all.  For further inquiry, feel free to visit the <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/museum/">Creation Museum</a> in Ohio, which has a wealth of useful, unbiased scientific information.

Oh, and also, the Internet doesn't exist.  It's a government conspiracy.
