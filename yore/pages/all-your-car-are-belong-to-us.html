Sometimes, I take it for granted that I live in a city whose award-winning and world-renowned towing industry is revered as the one of the most efficient car-removal systems in the country. But, as soon as I begin to forget this fact, I am reminded again by walking outside and finding my car in some other geographical location around northern Florida than where I left it the previous evening.

This happened to me this morning, which marks the fifth time in the past three years that the good folks of Tallahassee have decided to remove my car from the parking lot where I had hoped it would still be in the morning. This used to disturb me greatly. The first time I was towed, I was driving my lawyer boss's Mercedes Benz, which he delicately lent to me the night before. I came out of the apartment, saw it missing, thought, "It's on its way to Mexico", and then began mulling over efficient ways to take my own life.

Fortunately, however, I've learned over time that when I walk outside and the car is gone, that just means the towing guys are hard at work here in town. So, I make my usual rounds to the towing places ("Hey Casey"; "Hey Hal - how's the wife"), and eventually find my car. It's no sense arguing with them either; most of them speak a customized half-English, half-WhoKnowsWhat language designed specifically to keep people from negotiating with impound lot employees. It is said that if you can crack the code of one of these languages, you may have gone a long way to deciphering the world's economic problems.

As for actually towing cars, these companies will stop at no end. Most of the time, they tow cars from apartment parking lots around town, regardless of whether or not the "towee" (owner of a vehicle that is towed) actually lives at that particular complex or not. Hey, persistence and attention to detail counts! I have no doubt that they would tow from <a href="http://devca.net/blog-new/images/05-11-2005-EmptyLot.jpg">this</a> parking lot and then claim to the towee that they were freeing up spaces in the parking lot for residents that live there (among the trees).

I kid, I kid. I am sure that the towing companies have an extremely justified reason for towing each and every car they remove from parking lots around Tallahassee. Here, in fact, is a list of reasons on the towing notification form that Tallahassee companies use to justify removing a vehicle from a parking lot:
<blockquote><strong>You Were Towed Because:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Vehicle has no Parking Permit</li>
	<li>Vehicle not parked in the special "visitor section", consisting of exactly 3 spaces approximately 4 kilometers from the actual apartment units</li>
	<li>The towing company needs to meet tonight's quota</li>
	<li>The towing company doesn't like the way your vehicle looks</li>
	<li>The towing company doesn't like the way you look</li>
	<li>The towing company enjoys being annoying</li>
	<li>Vehicle was mistaken for an extraterrestrial spaceship and removed</li>
	<li>By the looks of your vehicle, you seem rich enough to give the towing company money</li>
	<li>The towing company was bored</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
I do take <em>some</em> responsibility for having been towed no less than five times from around this city in the past few years. I know full well that there are 32 towing companies around town, and they all have to make a profit, so I should expect to see a lot of cars ending up in the impound lot, including mine.

And if the gross number of towing companies hasn't make the picture clear enough for me, perhaps the sign on the way into town should have clued me in:
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Towahassee" id="image149" src="/yore/images/05-11-2005-towahassee.jpg" /></div>
Ah well, I guess that's just the way the world works. From now, I am going to be extra prudent; I will park my car in the next town over, hitchhike into Tallahassee, and then walk everywhere I need to go from now on.

Or I'll get a horse.
