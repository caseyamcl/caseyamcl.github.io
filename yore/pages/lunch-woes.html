Itâs interesting to read weblogs that are posted by top Microsoft programmers, company executives, or other really important people. They talk about visions, company culture, ideas for the future, and all kinds of new, interesting, provocative things. I talk about work, too. On my website, however, the subject of my posts is more likely to consist of: stories about lunch.

Lunch, of course, is the most important aspect of work. After all, most of us work to liveânot live to workâand in order to live, we also must eat. This is why lunch is so important, for executives and yours truly alike. Lately, though, it has become difficult to accomplish the task of eating lunch without serious challenges. To begin, one must consider the following options that I am faced with:
<ol>
	<li>Bring lunch and eat it at work.</li>
	<li>Eat out on campus</li>
	<li>Go home and eat lunch</li>
	<li>Starve</li>
</ol>
Let's explore each one of these options, shall we?

<b>Bring lunch and eat it at work</b>

This seems to be the most cost-effective, shortest, and easiest way to solve the issue of eating lunch. Just donât go anywhere â eat it at the desk. But, there exists a single fact that has kept me from doing this from the day I entered college: waking up. In order to bring lunch, you have to make lunch, or at least grab something from the kitchen to bring, and this is an impossibility for me at 6:30 in the morning. It ainât happening. I consider it a good day if I can find the door without running into it at that hour and actually have clothes on when I leave the apartment. So, if you think I can make a detour to the kitchen and pick up some food on my journey to consciousness for the day, think again.

<b>Eat out on Campus</b>

This would work fine, except that, given the captive consumer market, the prices are ridiculous on campus. That, and the risk exists for a <b>Lunch Encounter of the Third Kind</b> (the first and second kinds being undefined). The Third Kind is a lucnh break where anybody that happens to work in the same building as me comes to the same place.  I go to lunch with coworkers all the time, but when somebody shows up unexpectedly, things get a little uneasy. For example, the last day before Christmas break, I was sitting in Charcoal Grill on Tennessee Street reading up on ColdFusion, when who should walk in, but:
<ul>
	<li>My Boss</li>
	<li>My Boss's Boss</li>
	<li>My Boss's Boss's Boss</li>
</ul>
Wow, and my food had just come out from the kitchen. Talk about a bad lunch decision. There are 300 restaurants in the greater Florida State vicinity, and I have to choose the one that the people who give me work come to. (kind of says a lot about the vertical structure here at our relatively small institution, too, eh?) As a consequence of this experience, I have become a lot more methodological about how I do my eating out. First, I have to perform some reconnaissance, so if you see a guy slinking around under the windows, peering into various eating venues around campus, donât be alarmed; it's just me looking for somewhere to eat where I won't have to hear about Exchange rollovers and TPS reports.

<b>Go Home and Eat Lunch</b>

This has been a viable option for the past few weeks for me, but lately, it has become pretty difficult. This option came up after I thought about it carefully: (a) I have food at home; (b) I am hungry; (c) If I go to my home, I can eat the food that I have there. Unfortunately, things are rearely this simple. I soon came to remember that most of the food at home has to be prepared in one way or another, which causes problems for me.

Take yesterday, for instance. I went home and told myself, "Hey, whoâs up for some pancakes?" Then I thought, "I'm up for some pancakes - hook me up with some of those, yo." So, I took the pancake mix box out of the counter and glanced at the directions: (1) mix water and pancake mix; stir, (2) pour light layer of vegetable oil on skillet and turn oven surface unit to maximum temperature, (3) pour batter onto skillet, flip twice; heat for three minutes. Seemed simple enough.

What ended up happening was: (1) break open pancake mix box; watch pancake mix powder go all over kitchen, (1a) attempt to recover pancake mix and pour into bowl, (1b) slip and fall on pancake mix; curse some, (1c) pour water into bowl, (1d) accidentally tip bowl over, (1e) clean up runny pancake ooze from counter, (1f) stir, (2) find pan ("<em>is this a skillet?</em>"), (2a) pour really heavy layer of vegetable oil on skillet, (2b) turn oven surface unit to maximum temperature, (2c) watch vegetable oil sputter to heights unprecedented by grease in the past, (2d) attempt to not get burned by high-velocity oil kamikaze units, (3) pour extremely large amount of pancake batter onto skillet, (3a) watch that baby burn!, (3c) attempt to flip pancake, (3d) attempt to scrape blacked pancake remains off of pan, (3e) attempt to scrape melted plastic spatula of pan with fork, (3e) slip and fall on leftover pancake batter, (4) go to Arby's.

Thus, I learned that this was not a good option anymore, either, so I am left with only one, which a lot of people like me do at work anyways:

<b>Starve</b>

It's much easier not to eat, anyhow. My boss's boss's boss's boss (or something like that) once relayed his words of wisdom to me when he said, "to eat often is to show oneself to be meek. I never eat, and I only sleep once a week, and when I do sleep, it's standing up with my eyes open, and-" (I attempted to listen to the rest of his speech, but then he fell over dead).

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to lunch, or at least scope out places that I <em>may</em> go to lunch at if circumstances prove themselves to be equitable to my presence.
