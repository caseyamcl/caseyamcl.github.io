title: 'Cat Obesity'

I recently went over to a friends' apartment to visit, and encountered possibly the largest cat I have ever seen.  It greeted me when I opened the door, and the first thing I could utter was "ohmygod".  The sheer size of this cat invokes terror in any who encounter it.  I've seen my share of <a href="images/02-18-2006-FatCat.jpg">overweight kitties</a>, but this cat trumps all of them.  There's no question about how this cat grew to its current gargantuan, and somewhat freightening, size.

This guy, my friend, was making brownies and pausing at frequent intervals to feed the cat batter from the spoon.  I wanted to ask my friend if he was just negligent in taking care of the cat (which would not be okay), or if he was conducting a scientific experiment to see how much matter a single cat could intake before exploding (which would, of course, be okay).

Throughout the evening, I became as used to the size of this animal as humanly possible, and the cat and I settled into routine of mutual tolerance, so long as I didn't move too quickly in its vicinity or come too close to its chocolate cake.  Several fat cat jokes crossed my mind, though, and in the interest of meaningful content, I will share them with you here (insert your own at will):

The cat was so obese, that....  (rim shot implied where appropriate)
<ul>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that when it walks around the apartment, the ground shakes.</li>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that you cannot see its legs when it stands up.</li>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that it has to be fed out of a horse trough.</li>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that it has to go through a car-wash for cleaning.</li>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that you need a forklift to carry it from one location to another.</li>
	<li>The cat is so obese, that it recently mated with a St. Bernard and gave birth to cogs and dats.</li>
</ul>
Seriously, the cat is really obese.
