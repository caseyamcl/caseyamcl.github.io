I sit here in Robert Manning Strozier Library for not the first night in my life, and I am reminded of a <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/2003_10_01_weblog_archive.php#106539145105591706">post</a> that I put up over a year ago detailing what I thought the library was: a singles club for the incredibly introverted.  I stated that guys go to the library for the sole purpose of scoping out girls, who are actually trying to get work done.  I take all of it back.  I was mistaken.

Apparently, all of us guys actually <em>do</em> come here to work; at least these days we do.  I walked into the library tonight to take an online class, and I noticed right off the bat the diversity of all of the people here.  There are us Caucasians, some Asian people, several African American dudes, and a bunch of other nondescript people of all shapes and sizes studiously hunched over books and papers on this second week of school.  In all of this diversity at the library, there was one group of people missing: females.

Not a single one did I see here at the library.  One wonders how this is at a school that is made up of over 60% girls.  With these disproportionate statistics, it must be wondered where all the girls are.  Are they all doing their hair at the exact same time?  Perhaps there is a separate library setup somewhere on campus where all of the girls go now.  Maybe I've entered a single-gender parallel universe.

One thing is for sure, my <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/2003_10_01_weblog_archive.php#106539145105591706">singles club</a> theory is right out the window.  Nobody comes here to pick people up; they come here to learn!  It's like I was thrown back four decades in time to when people actually came to college to do something with their lives.  Incredible.

Cynicism aside, it is refreshing to know that people still go to the library every now and then.  Maybe this will lead to a new trend.  Maybe somebody will actually check out a book one day, too.  It looks like those poor people behind the circulation desk might actually gain some job security in the near future!  ...you know, the ones that stand there behind the desk all day with their hand hovering over the bookstamp, staring at you with wide and hopeful eyes, dying to put an expiration date on the back cover of some piece of literature, but never getting to?  Judging by the number of dudes in here, the book that is checked out will probably be an art manual with lots of naked people in it.

I know my own gender (I already checked that book out once).

In the meantime, I guess the only real singles activity on Florida State Campus will continue to be the half-second glances people dart at each other as they race towards their destinations at supersonic speeds.
