See? Simple.

Everything is quantifiable. You can use systems of quantification everyday, especially where you work, which can be a drag sometimes. For instance, bad situations at work can generally be ranked in a three-tier system that identifies levels of frustration. Some examples are as follows:

<strong>Darn:</strong> The coffee pot is empty
<strong>Damn:</strong> The coffee can is empty
<strong>#$*(:</strong> We won't be ordering coffee for two weeks

<strong>Darn:</strong> I hear the server beeping from outside the door when I come to the office.
<strong>Damn:</strong> The server has been down for the last twelve hours and needs a special part from some guy in China to fix it.
<strong>#$*(:</strong> The server room is on fire.

<strong>Darn:</strong> Somebody forgot their e-mail password.
<strong>Damn:</strong> It's the Boss.
<strong>#$*(:</strong> He hasn't had his prozac today.

These examples seem a little negative, and I'm definitely not a negative sort of guy. There are positive ways to measure circumstances as well. Let's focus our positive energy now; I find the best way to do this requires comparative measures. In other words, whenever you start to get whiney, simply go to Google and type in "bad day at work". This way, you can compare your day to somebody who is worse off, pity that person, and then get on with life. Everybody is a winner... or something like that.

Really, though, this post is really just an excuse to publish that big math equation I spent a half hour drawing. I just figured I had to come up with some pseudo-interesting content to accompany it so I could put it on the website. With that out in the open, let's just say I don't really have any pseudo-interesting content right now, so I'll just leave you with the following picture, appropriately-themed for this post:
