I am officially <em>the</em> youngest person here.  Sitting down at a table for lunch, I asked the guy next to my right what he did.  "Chief Information Officer," he said.  The guy to the left of me chimed in, "Hey, I'm I CIO, too!"  The guy on the right said, "Oh yeah? How big is your college?" ... "30,000 students" ... "Really.. mine has 42,000 students!" ... "Well, I make $180,000" ... "I make $210,000," and so the conversation went.  Then, as with most conversations go amongst conference people, the discussion quickly turned to baseball, and then to how many kids they have, and then to their hernia.

Where are the young people?  Where are the 20-somethings?  Don't these Educause people care about the future of their institutions?  Where are the dudes in board shorts and the girls with the retardedly oversized sunglasses?  Where is my generation?

The conference is going well, though.  In some demon-possessed daze a few weeks ago, I volunteered to help out in collecting names of people at the seminars I attend and in introducing speakers and whatnot.  Why I volunteered, I don't know, but now the conference speakers have my name and they call on me for everything.  "Hey, the projector isn't work.  Casey, can you fix that?" ... "So and so doesn't have a lunch ticket.  Casey, can you fix that?" ... "There is a hair in my coffee; it might be mine, but, Casey can't you fix that?"  I feel like I should be getting paid!

On a positive note, they have free coffee, which is reason enough to drive four hours.  Tonight I have to go to a cocktail party one of the vendors I use is holding, which ought to provide me with plenty of material.  More on that later.
