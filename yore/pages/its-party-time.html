title: 'It''s Party Time!'

Much to the dismay of the vast majority of students here at Florida State University, we have dropped completely off of the top #20 party schools, as ranked by the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com">Princeton Review</a>.  This, as far as I remember being in the undergraduate program, used to be considered a high source of pride around campus.  The ranking is, to say the least, based upon less scientific methods than other Princeton Review rankings, but does take into account the reported drug/alcohol use, (lack of) study time, and popularity of the Greek system.

Fortunately for our students' egos, we still appear at the top of the "Their Students (almost) Never Study" and "Jock Schools" lists.  A "Jock School", I read, is a school that takes sports and fraternities in very high regard.

Last night, I got invited to go out to "party" at one of the bars on Tennessee Street.  I decided that I would go, and had a wild and crazy time.  Or, a pseudo-wild and crazy time... or, well--let's face it--if this is what we call "party" here at FSU, I have no idea why students are obsessed with participating.  Wouldn't they rather be doing something <em>fun</em>?  I will attempt to describe the scene for you and let you decide for yourself:

We walk up to the bar.  There is a line to get in, but it moves pretty quickly, and I am face-to-face with a guy the size of Godzilla motioning to see my ID.  He looks at it for what seems like 10 minutes, and then asks where Eustis, the place listed as my permanent address, is located.  He has, like, three teeth.  Apparently, asking where the place on your ID card is geographically located is supposed to psyche you out and catch you off guard.  This may work if you have the IQ of frozen yogurt.  My ID being genuine, I lie to him just for the fun of it, and he lets me in the door.

The "club" is a big empty room about twice the size of a Burger King, which looked like it has sustained serious fire damage in the recent past.  There is a stage, but no live entertainment.  TV monitors abound, hanging from the ceiling.  There are three bars on three sides of the room.  It's "80's Night", so loud 80's music is blaring on the speakers.  Music Videos from 25 years ago appear on the TV monitors.

It's around 10:30, which is considered early for FSU students, most of whom don't wake up before midnight.  The room, however, is getting pretty full.  My friend tells me that we need to go stake out a table, which is a problem, because in the entire room, there is only one table, and that is being occupied by some guy, even bigger than the bouncer, who has decided to use it as a chair.  We do the best we can and begin the activity of "partying" with everybody else.

This is where my idea of party begins to differ with the general populace.  The basic idea behind partying is to have a good time, meet people, goof off, and relax.  Here, however, the atmosphere was awkward and completely non-conducive to communication, let alone human interaction.  This may have not been the idea of the club-owners, but it certainly has been the result.  I believe the powers-that-be at institutions like this one try to create an environment where you can meet a person, dance with her (or him, for that matter), and then go home with her without having to worry about all of that "talking" or "knowing each other" stuff.  This arrangement is based upon the assumption that college students are generally mentally inept and have nothing to say to each other.

The scene was this: an ever-growing mass of human bodies, most of whom were standing around in little groups of three or four, holding glasses of extremely (no exaggeration here) cheap booze.  We had our little group, too.  Everybody had a glass of cheap booze, except one of my friends, who had purchased a fish-bowel full of what looked like red food coloring, sugar, and water, with maybe a single shot of vodka in it.  There was a group of Mexican guys right behind us, arms folded, looking mean, and standing right next to the women's restroom.  They did not speak to each other, nor to anyone else, but instead just stood there watching girls go in and out of the bathroom while chain smoking.

After a half hour, the rest of the club was beginning to become very, very crowded with people standing around holding drinks.  I saw some girl feign dancing to the 80's music for a few moments, saw that someone was watching her, and then abruptly halt and resume her catatonic position of glass-holding.  My friend tried saying something to me, "thanks for driving us", which came out over the music as a distant "thmumfh furf flying fus!"

There were people dancing, on the far side of the room, or so it appeared.  After a long, difficult haul through the mass of human bodies, I found the stage, which was occupied by drunk people moving to the music by waving their arms and bouncing up and down.  Outside, on the balcony overlooking the six-lane highway, there was a mass of people checking the screens on their cell phones.  This is a popular past-time with my generation.  Don't have anything to do?  Whip out the phone, and see if anyone has called you in the past three minutes!

A girl came up to me and shouted, "Hey, havin' fun?!"

I shouted back, "Yeh.  Sure."

"Yeah, I know this place can be kind of a drag when you're sober!"

She then proceeded to vomit over the balcony.

By this time, the crowd was so massive that one could barely move at all.  Making my way back across the club to the place where my friends were standing around staring at each other was extremely difficult.  Imagine a crowded subway and multiply that by a factor of ten.  If you were having, say, an epilepsy attack and needed to vacate the room immediately, you'd require a flame thrower to get through.  It would almost make more sense to try to walk over the mass of bodies than through it.  By this time, any thought of dancing to the 80's music was out of the question; you were lucky to get your fair share of oxygen in a place like this.

It was at this point that we decided to leave.  So, we pushed through the mob of flesh by sheer force of forward momentum.  As I walked out the door, I noticed that <em>they were still letting people in!</em>.  It was 12:30 now, and the line stretched twice as long as it has before.  I imagined that, after a few hours, the walls one either side of the club would start pushing in towards each other like a giant compactor, mashing the party-goers into a blob of goo in order to make way for new arrivals.  Then I thought, ânah, the club owners would never do something that cost <em>that</em> much money.  It's all about maximizing profits.

I thought about having to pay to experience a place like that club every weekend, and decided that I'm either starting to get old prematurely, or I'm the only person who actually still has a good handle on the meaning of enjoying oneself.

The club we were in was one of about a dozen on Tennessee Street, the six-lane highway that borders FSU, in Tallahassee.  At each club we passed on the way back to my car, there was a line to get in at least as long as the one outside of the club we just left.  Almost every club is exactly the same: big empty room, horribly prepared drinks, and lots of people standing around in little groups.  This is big business here in Tallahassee, and it seems that more and more students are willing to participate in clubs/bars that are less and less clean, entertaining, comfortable, interesting, or managed well just for an opportunity to feel like their fitting into the social norm.

Here in Tallahassee, and at other universities across the nation, kids come in from high school desperate to become a part of local society, and this is what they are presented as the norm.  So, whether its fun for them or not, they fall into this groove of going to some big, empty room every Saturday night, standing around, holding a glass, checking their phone on a periodic basis, maybe meeting somebody once or twice, and then doing it again next weekend.  I guess it's something to do between television and class.

In the meantime, education standards are falling ever more so around the country.  Another <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060120.wliter0120/BNStory/International/">recent examination</a> concluded that the majority of students failed when asked to balance a checkbook, understand newspaper commentary (written in common vernacular), or read a simple table.  It is important to note that more older adults than college students failed these tests when asked the same questions.  Regardless, if a student doesn't understand what the word "hereinafter" means, doesn't know what century the American Civil War was fought, and cannot multiply 20 x 15, is that person really fit to live in a society where communication and the manipulation of information are two of the most important skills?

At least we know how to use our cell phones.
