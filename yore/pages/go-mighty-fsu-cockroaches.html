There has been a lot of flack over this whole mascot thing at FSU. Apparently, the NCAA is attempting to make the University come up with a new, more PC mascot that is less offensive to the Seminole tribe, who expressed great concern over the matter, stating for the record, "The Florida State whosits want do what with the what?  Listen, we have a casino to run."

They apparently couldn't care less. I suppose the NCAA just needed a mission in life,  having thus completed... come to think of it, what has the NCAA done anyhow?  Stripping an institution of 60 years of heritage seemed to be a mighty fine idea to them, in any case.  Thus, we may lose the privilege to call ourselves the "Seminoles" (and Notre Dame still gets to satarize the Irish - what gives?).  But, in the name of political correctness, I guess I'll do what is necessary and propose here some alternative mascots that FSU may wish to think about endorsing:

<strong><i>Make some noise for the Florida State...</i></strong>





<strong>...Bunny Rabbits</strong> - Okay. You may think that I'm nuts here, but come on... a bunny rabbit can be a pretty competitive mascot. Think about that bunny rabbit from "Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail". Yeah that rabbit did a lot of @$$ kicking. Or, perhaps, the rabbit from "Donnie Darko". I am sure I can come up with at least two more examples of bunny rabbits, but I'll just stop right here, and move onto <i>The Florida State...</i>

<strong>...Cockroaches</strong> - What better mascot to say, "We're here and never, ever, ever going away" than cockroaches? After all, they've been since before electrons existed, and I am convinced that, even after the Universe has imploded in on itself, they will still be around, annoying somebody.  I can hear the announcer: "Infesting a stadium near you, the Florida State Cockroaches".  This mascot, of course, may be the butt of a lot of "Raid" jokes, so we may wish to consider instead, <i>...The Florida State...</i>

<strong>...Death Rays of Doom</strong> - I don't know how politically correct this or isn't; I just like it. In fact, if Florida State doesn't adopt the Death Rays of Doom mascot, I think I'll start a sports team simply so I can use the name.  Yeah!  DEATH RAYS OF DOOM! [ahem] We could also become, <i>The Florida State...</i>

<strong>...Nazi's</strong> - Do you ever notice that roughly half of those first-person shooter video games made in the past three decades feature Nazis as the target of punishment? It's not as if you're shooting something arbitrary, like extraterrestrials who have landed on Earth to enslave humans and conduct research involving anal probes. No, it's just Nazi's... you can bulldoze them down by the dozens, and you won't see the NCAA knocking on your door looking to confiscate your video game system. In the same way, FSU can avoid any potential punishment from the NCAA by adopting this mascot that doesn't belittle anybody that we don't already consider it politically correct to kill off by the hundreds. Instead of the Seminole Chop, I can see 80,000 "Hail Hitlers" in the stands. I'm sure <i>nobody</i> will be offended by that.  Again, I'll just stop right here with this one and suggest, <i>The Florid State...</i>

<strong>...Offenders</strong> - Why not just become what the NCAA apparently thinks we are?  After all, just about every mascot anybody can think of <a href="http://rhog.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_rhog_archive.html#112415754344818245">can be thought of as potential offensive to <i>somebody</i></a>. Besides, the name works on so many levels. For instance, half of the players have already been kicked off the team this year, because they have been charged for criminal offenses. See?? It fits! Instead of singing the War Chant, fans could make offensive finger gestures and shout obscenities from the stands during games. Oh wait, that already happens.

In any case, I really hope that I haven't offended anybody with this post, especially not the NCAA.  If you are, in fact, offended by anything you see on this site, you can report it at the following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:dickcheney@whitehouse.gov">dickcheney@whitehouse.gov</a>.
