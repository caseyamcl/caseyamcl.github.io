I seem to have trouble obtaining food at times that I need it most.  In the case of this past Saturday morning, I travelled 100 miles before I was able to find anything to consume whatsoever.

The day started off okay as this weary traveler (still a little woozy from a "formal" party the night before) woke up at seven a.m. to make the 250 mile trip from Tallahassee to Orlando.  "I'll just get some food on the road," I told myself; but, I should have known better.  For, the "road" that I was referring to is Interstate 10 through Florida, which is to roads what Deliverance is to cinema.  This stretch of road is best known for its (a) many trees, (b) lack of modern civilization of any kind, (c) that burnt down Texaco station halfway to Lake City symbolizing the deptitude and deprecation of any real modern life out there.

This, of course means that my chances of getting food were severely limited to (a) eating my own flesh, or (b) eating somebody else's flesh, and I really wasn't in the mood to do either -- perhaps it was because I was so tired.  In any case, despite the fact that I <em>know</em> that there is no food up there in the "backwoods", I made it a point to attempt to anyways.
<ul>
	<li>Stop #1 - I stopped at a McDonald's which was crammed into the side of a gas station.  They actually had a drive-thru, which is really something.  However, the woman at the window kindly informed me that their menu was severely limited (coon-head and taters, I'm guessing) and that they would accept no form of payment other than "cold hard cash", which, I, being a college student, I obviously have none of.</li>
	<li>Stop #2 - I saw a sign for a Burger King (the first in many miles) and thought that I would try once again find some nourishment since I was now beginning to hallucinate about prime rib.  Apparently, I found the only oasis of food within about 1,000 miles.  Even though the drive-thru line was in fact not working due to "computer problems" (apparently the mouse on the treadmill died), one could go inside to order something.  That is, if that individual wanted to stand in line with every man, woman, child, dog, and cow in Jefferson county.  It looked like the food line at a Russian Gulag.  I chose to fore go the day-long wait and press on.</li>
	<li>Stop #3 - This wasn't exactly a stop.  It was more like a near-skidding into the guard rail as I passed over the only Interstate exit I had seen with actual, true-to-life, restaurants, going about 90 miles per hour.  I will tell you this from first-hand experience:  If your car has already overshot the exit (i.e. gone past it), do not attempt to actually exit.  This may cause severe damage to your car and yourself.</li>
	<li>Stop #4 - I finally arrived in Lake City, which is kind of like the light of the tunnel in terms of getting into post-B.C.-era civilization.  Once again, I stopped at what was the only seemingly convenient place to retrieve nourishment, Burger King.  The drive-thru worked and everything seemed fine until the lady at the window informed me that the only payment they accepted was, again, cash.  I eventually got my sandwich, and she got a lot of pennies.</li>
</ul>
The moral of this story?  If you are evr in the Tallahassee area traveling on I-10, leave.
