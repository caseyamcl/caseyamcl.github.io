Well, after about six hours of coding from the ground up, I have finally gotten my Commenting system up and going.  Most people would have just downloaded one from a third-party provider, but nooo.  Not yours truly.  I decided that, since I knew so much about PHP, I would just go ahead and build my own.

Actually, I knew barely anything about PHP.  And, I knew even less about mySQL.

<em>But I learned! ...and...</em>

I have not only built a small, scalable mySQL database for this site, I also built some <em>object-oriented</em> PHP code, threw in some javascript, implemented some code into my weblog template, and <em>viola</em>... a commenting system was born.

Feel free to use it, and let me know if you have any problems!
