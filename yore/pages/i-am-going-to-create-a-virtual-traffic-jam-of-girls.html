In the course of my trying to become a more responsible web poster dude and update, care for, water, and speak nicely to my website, I happened to check my web statistics page the other day.  This page is great in that it tells me things like 549 different people have actually looked at this site this month so far, which is incredible considering the obtuse and explicit lack of anything provocative lately, save for this post.

It also tells me what the most frequently occurring search queries were that brought people to my site.  I looked at it the other night and, contrary to my presuppositions, it was "<strong>college guys</strong>".  This query had brought people to my site more  than three times as much as the second runner up, "decapitated".  Other top queries included "Macbeth Head", "Your Stupid", "Milk Baggies", and, of course, "Ally McBeal Pics", referencing my all-too steamy <a href="http://devca.net/blog/images/9-26-2003-SkeletonPic.jpg">pictures of Ally McBeal </a> from a September, 2003 post.  But, the top by far was "<strong>college guys</strong>".

Well, well, ladies...

...I didn't know you were such connoisseurs of my site, but now that I have you here (::nonchalantly pops a breath mint into mouth::), I think I shall woo you with my vast knowledge of 16 - 19th century French Literature:

(ahem)

Before any <strong>college guys</strong> were around (like me; I am a <strong>college guy</strong>), there was a man named Pierre Cornielle, who was a French Poet of the 17th century.  Needless to say, given the lack of any <strong>college guys</strong>, he did not write about <strong>College Guys</strong>, but instead mirrored the drama of Shakespeare on the French stage and went on to publish many complete works that have made there way into the annals of time and literary history.  Very few <strong>College Guys</strong> will read any of his books, or even know where to find them in a library, since that task requires effort, interest, and the ability to navigate an information space.  However, there are some who say his works transcend any particular genre, and are beyond classification, which I doubt any <strong>College Guys</strong> would do anyhow.  Tony Kushner, who once living in a dorm with other <strong>College Guys</strong> recently adapted one of his more famous works, "Le Illusion".

Moving on, another member of the French literary regime is the late Victor Hugo, who also has nothing to do with <strong>College Guys</strong>.  His works, on the other hand, deal with the oppressed of society, and all have strong statements about the inadequacies of the late French Government of his time, particularly the law enforcing branches thereof.  So, while no <strong>College Guys</strong> were included in his novels, there were many famous works that are still in print today and circulating widely even outside of classrooms wherein <strong>College Guys</strong> are forced to read them against their will (or at least skim the Cliff Notes).  His most famous is "Les Miserables", but arguably his best would definitely be "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", which has been made into countless movies which I am sure some former <strong>College Guys</strong> have played a part in producing.  In all, his large repitiore of work can be read in almost any western language, but is most impressive in its native French, which very few American <strong>College Guys</strong> can speak fluently.

Finally, we come to Alexandre Dumas who was one of the first pop-fiction writers in modern history.  His books, however, are listed in with the literary greats because of the intricacy in plot, incredible literary flair, and complex characters.  Dumas, in addition to being a traveler and a writer, was also a promiscuous womanizer, which most <strong>College Guys</strong> would be extremely impressed with.  Again, we see his books being printed still, and some <strong>College Guys</strong> probably work in printing shops that do this, but that is mere speculation.  As is more probable, the books are produced and printed by machines, which were designed by <strong>College Guys</strong> of the mechanical engineering type.

As you can see, French literature of the 19th century is still a very large part of culture even here in our modern American society.  Though we now have an entirely different paradigm of life, especially in American colleges, where <strong>College Guys</strong> and Girls are, the same simple truths echoed through time in literature still hold true and will continue to as long as the civilized world continues to turn.

That ought to do it; go to town, Google Spider!  Just watch all the <strong><em>college girls</em></strong> come pouring in the cybergates of my website.. Muwhahahahhaa.. <strong>College Guys</strong> <strong>College Guys</strong> <strong>College Guys</strong> <strong>College Guys</strong> <strong>College Guys</strong>
