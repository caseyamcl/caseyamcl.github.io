This blog now resides at a new place in Cyberspace!  I've picked up the whole site, loaded it on a flatbed truck, drove it (at 5 mph, making some web-motorists very unhappy) to www.devca.net, my new stomping ground.  If you are reading this annoucment, that means that you're already here, so way to go.

The new URL for my blog is <a href="www.devca.net/blog">www.devca.net/blog</a>
