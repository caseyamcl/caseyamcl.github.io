<u><strong>Overview</strong></u>

It seems appropriate to write my first running trail review on one of Tallahassee's most popular trails.

The St. Marks Trail is a long, flat stretch of asphalt that starts on Capital Circle Southeast and heads straight through Woodville and the Apalachicola National Forest dumping you out in downtown St. Marks.

It's a great trail to run if you are trying to hit 16 miles for the first time, since it is flat, straight, and never too far from the highway, or from help.

<u><strong>Experience</strong></u>

<em>**Note: If you're going to run this trail from start to finish, you are going to need to have somebody pick you up in St. Marks, unless you want to run 16 more miles back!  Tell them to take Monroe South from Downtown for about 22 miles until it dead-ends at the Riverside Cafe in St. Marks.  The trail also ends right at the restaurant, so it's a good place to meet up.
</em>
You can begin at several places along the trail.  Most people start in Tallahassee and run south.  The first major parking lot is located at Capital Circle and Woodville Highway, about six miles south of downtown.  Basically, you take Monroe Street south from the Capitol until you pass over Capital Circle.  The parking lot will be on your right.  There is also a park you can put your car at about two miles further down the road; it's a right hand turn.  There's a third park eight miles further down the road (at the trail's halfway point) on the right as well.
The first parking lot at Capital Circle is the main parking lot, and it is usually crowded with the many bikers, runners, and roller-bladers that use the trail.  There are also fairly decent restrooms and water fountains that taste really bad.  As of 2007, trail authorities have installed a cooling station that sprays water, and there are benches and hoses.  It's a good place to stretch.  Pay attention to the signs that warn you about running alone in heavily wooded, rural areas.

The trail begins at the south end of the parking lot.  From here on out, it's pretty much a straight shot to St. Marks.  The first two miles may be a bit disillusioning if you don't like running near auto traffic, because you're running literally feet from the busy Woodville Highway, and the traffic is loud, smelly, and obnoxious.  Don't let this get you down, though, because after about two miles, the trail veers away from the highway for the rest of the way.

The trail is also a bit crowded for the first two to six miles.  Most people seem to turn around before the halfway point, though, and you may find yourself running alone for several miles further towards St. Marks.

At the beginning of the trail, you'll notice marks on the pavement indicating how far you've gone every quarter mile.  After the second mile, these disappear .  But, there are plastic markers sticking out of the ground every mile indicating your progress all the way to St. Marks.  If you like to track your distance in kilometers, pay attention, because the pavement is marked with kilometers all the way to St. Marks as well.
If you are doing a short run, then I recommend skipping the first two miles of the trail altogether and driving down about two miles past the first parking lot.  There will be a park off of Woodville Highway on the right you can put your car at, and begin running south from there.  That way, you avoid running right next to busy Woodville Highway.
A note about the park:  It's a great little pit-stop, and if you're looking for water, you need to head to the baseball diamonds.  Otherwise, just keep running.

Around mile four, you'll get into some rural housing developments in Woodville. You'll run through some neighborhoods for a few miles, and then you're back in the woods again.  There will be some sparse houses around for the next several miles.  At this point, you're parallel with Old Woodville Highway, which is used by the locals, and turns into a dirt road for a ways.  Not much traffic; in fact, I couldn't even tell the road was there until a pickup truck came up on it last time I ran it.

Around mile eight, you'll pass the Halfway point park.  This is a good place to put your car, as well, if you want a starting point even further down the trail.  Grab some water or use the restroom, or just keep chugging along.  You get into some deeper woods around mile 11, and you'll pass by some giant power lines around mile 13.

Hang in there, you're almost done!  I can't say much about miles 13, 14, and 15, because I have only run them in the dark, which I would highly discourage for safety reasons.  You will be surrounded by swamp; I do know that.

Finally, after your long run, you will be dumped out a few yards west of the Riverside Cafe in St. Marks.  Go congratulate yourself with a beer, because you'll need it!  Woodville Highway is a few yards to the left of the trail.  Also, if you end up at the cafe on Monday night, you don't want to miss the karaoke.  It's an--hmm.. interesting-- experience you simply cannot get anywhere else in the world for obvious reasons...
If you don't like pounding pavement or being snuck up on by bikes, there are numerous horse trails jutting off of the main, paved section that honestly never seen an actual horse-rider on.  The horse trails criss-cross the main trail many, many times.
