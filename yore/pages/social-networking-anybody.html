The Internet has brought us many great things, like <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">Hot-or-Not.com</a>, <a href="http://www.psychicpaintings.com/">Pyshcic Paintings</a> and <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howtos/ht/fakesnot.htm">tutorials on how to make fake snot</a>, so I imagine that anybody reading this post can see the value of this post has a deep and profound respect for the networked world of the twenty-first century.

Us geeks in the information culture weren't about to stop there, though. We decided that we would invent this thing called "social networking" wherein you could now not only shop from home on the Internet, read literature at home on the Internet, get your "special pictures" at home on the Internet, etc., but now you could also form friendships-and sometimes more-right from your computer .. at home, on the Internet. If you were really lucky, you might even see a picture of the person you were talking to. If you were <em>really, really</em> lucky, that picture would actually be <em>of</em> the person you met.

This social networking trend on the Internet has worked out fairly well, with many sites popping up in the past few years dedicated to people meeting other people online.

Some of these include, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>, <a href="http://www.tickle.com/">Tickle.com</a>, and everybody's new favorite, Mark Zuckerberg's <a href="http://www.thefacebook.com/">TheFaceBook</a>.  This particular social networking site has become immensely popular among college students, and it continues to grow.

What makes this particular site so appealing?  Well, I submit a few possible hypotheses:

<strong>One...</strong> TheFaceBook allows individuals to find out where their old high-school buddies are.  This is all good and well unless you are trying to hide from your old-high school buddies.  Then I wouldn't recommend going on this service, because they can look you up and add you to their friends list, even if the only thing they did in high school was stuff you in the trash can on a weekly basis.

<strong>Two...</strong> TheFaceBook allows one to gain an objective sense of one's interconnectedness, or put more simply, popularity among friends. I have an account on this service, which is connected to exactly 19 people at FSU. By most people's standards, that would imply a pretty dinky group of friends. To some, TheFaceBook represents a quantitative, definitive, and final measurement of one's success in the social world. By this logic, the 19 figure should depress me, but if I take into account the facts that:
<ul>
	<li>I don't really spend a lot of time hunting out friends on this services</li>
	<li>I am not using my full name in my profile, so it's really hard to find my listing, even if you're looking for me</li>
	<li>Most of my fellow graduate school peers don't even know what TheFaceBook is. They're too busy pouring over statistics books somewhere in the bowels of the library</li>
</ul>
The point is, here that, even if you wish to accept the flawed reasoning that more friends equals more success in life, TheFaceBook certainly can provide a number, but definitely not a true profile of one's interconnectedness. Consider the fact that many people add people to their "Friends" list merely to have, well, more friends on their list. In fact, I think just about everybody using TheFaceBook.com does this.

and <strong>Three...</strong> Perhaps the strongest motivator for using online social networking as opposed to the old-fashioned in-person method is the safety involved. I am not talking about physical or intellectual safety, although those is definitely factors; rather, I am talking about a sense security, socially speaking. The Internet provides a relatively safe turf and a less personal, thus less intimidating, environment for people to interact. It has been shown by some studies that people who tend to be more shy in face-to-face interactions are a bit more assertive when interacting over the 'net.

Face it, most os us put profiles of ourselves online in order to sell ourselves as an individuals. Again, going with the general trends, most profiles are selling to a specific audience, i.e. the opposite gender (or same, I guess, in some cases). Regardless, here is my hypothesis regarding Thefacebook.com, and why I think Mr. Zuckerberg, whether he knew it or not, created a perfect product in the 'net-based social interaction market. Ahem...

Most people are too embarrassed to put profiles of themselves onto any of the many online dating sites. Doing so implies a sense of social dejectedness. While society dictates that it is better to fall for someone through serendipitous social encounters, having to resort to a system designed to facilitate the process via computers (of all the geeky things to have to use) is looked upon as something, well, something "rejected people" do as a last resort.

Of course, this social myth holds little truth value, especially if one examines the demographics of online dating profiles. Still, it affects the behavior of many people who would otherwise freely partake in online dating sites. Most people, especially college-aged people, are extremely hesitant to use a computer application to assist in their love-life.

This is where TheFaceBook.com really shines as an ouststanding creation. It is not presented as a dating site, even though, at least in (very large) part, that is exactly what it is. The possibilities for meeting people of the opposite gender are greatly increased through TheFaceBook, since the interactions do not have to be seen by either party as being a serious move in the direction of dating. The service allows people to meet and interact on a deceptively platonic level. This provides not only the buffer of the security that the Internet offers, but also the buffer of seemingly appropriate and socially acceptable interactions for the medium. In other words, right now, it's the cool thing to do to be on TheFaceBook.com, "poke" other people, form groups, and do other things that eventually lead to the meeting of certain "special" individuals.

Or maybe I have it all wrong.  It would be an interesting study to see how people interact within the constricted environment of TheFaceBook.com.

All I know is that if I went around "poking" people in real life, I'm pretty sure that my popularity would <i>decrease</i>, not increase.  Or maybe I'm wrong about that, too.  Perhaps I should give it a shot.
