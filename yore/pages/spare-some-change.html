I'm moving on up.  They're putting me in the server room at work.  Most people would probably give me some kind of weird look and then a sarcastic glance when I tell them I'm excited about it.  After all, the server room is this room with no windows that has enough RF floating around in it to make me sterile for the rest of my life and approximately 1523 decibels of fan noise.  Plus there is this other guy in there (the Network Administrator) who listens to country music a lot.  But, really, it's a major step up from the Cubicle Without Walls<sup>(TM)</sup>.  First of all, I get walls.  Secondly, I get privacy.  Thirdly, I get to listen to country music-no wait, scratch that last one.  But, it'll be good.  Now I can finally hang that, "Bow to me, for I am Root" banner over my desk, and it will make sense.

They're going to be moving my desk about the same time I'm moving my apartment.  My life will change a lot on July 1.  One day, I'll come home and wonder who I am, what my name is, where I am supposed to go everyday, and what time lunch is.  The world will have been turned upside down.  Everything will be insane.  I, for one, am looking forward to it.

In other news, I went and saw Star Wars on Saturday night, defying all of my self-imposed rules that I will not see that movie until it's not cool to do it anymore  -- in other words, 2032.  But, what else was I going to do at 12:15 a.m. on Sunday morning?  It was pretty good, actually, and when I told my coworkers that exact phrase ("It was pretty good") this morning, they gave me a look as if to say, "you're not a real man," and then changed the subject.  The correct phrase would have been, "It made my life complete," or maybe just incessant, lustful drooling.  Maybe I should start working in the art department or something, only they would probably lack understanding of my lack of a Star Wars obsession, too.

That's it for now.  In case anybody is looking for any provocative or interesting content this week, I have provided you with this picture:

Have a nice day!
