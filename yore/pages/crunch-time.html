And I'm not talking about the variety of crunching, as in, "crunching on some good popcorn".  I'm talking about the it's-the-end-of-the-term-oh-geez-everything's-due; better-get-it-done-or-my-career-is-over type of crunch.  So, I've been getting up close and personal with the cubicle at work, spending long hours after closing typing up all kinds of jibberish about information retrieval, sequential chronological relationships, part-aggregate links, and other big words that somebody with too may syllables in their life came up with.

In order to accomplish this massive task and get everything done before 10:00 p.m. tonight, I have employed the use of a few liquid agents.  In other words, there is more caffiene in my system right now than the Mountain Dew processing plant contains, and I'm feeling gre-eat!  I am pretty sure that the feeling of euphoria, however, will instaneously dissapear however, at the least opportune of moments causing me to fall asleep on the keyboard and just start drooling.  But until that time, I'm going to realkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Whoops, looks like that time came a little quicker than expected.

Time for another Mellow Yellow (which is anything <em>but</em> mellow, my friends).

Okay, three hours and 52 minutes to go until my term paper needs to be submitted.  It's time to hit the paper again with a red pen.  In the meantime, I invite you to check out what has been the source of my stress-relief all week when I've needed it: <a href="http://home.tiscali.be/dinodino/jeux/">This extremely meaningful site</a>.

See you on the other side of Crunch Time (hopefully, this will be soon).
