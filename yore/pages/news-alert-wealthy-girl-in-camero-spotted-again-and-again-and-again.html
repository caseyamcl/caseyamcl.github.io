Driving at FSU has always been a full-contact sport... Actually, let me rephrase that... moving around in any particular fashion whatsoever at FSU has always been a full contact sport, but lately things have gotten downright unmannerly.  It seems that the decline in the total cumulative intelligence quota (we're down to what.. 0.42 total here now) here on campus has been supplemented with extremely unethical driving.  I am not going to single out any particular group of people here, as that would be extremely prejudice, overgeneralized, and unfair, but the problem seems to be concentrated mainly within the population strata of girls in extremely overpriced vehicles, talking on cellular phones, with hair that is, but is not naturally, colored blonde.

While, I'm in the process of making overly broad generalizations, I definitely don't want to be unfair and single out only the aforementioned group.  There are also many other drivers out there that pedestrians have to watch out for.  They are as follows:

You have the shirtless redneck/punk pickup truck driving rednecks who have confederate flags painted all over everything they own, including, but not limited to, their house, their lawn, their clothing, their pets, their own anatomy, and especially their truck.  God Bless America, they're making a statement, even if they're not entirely sure what that statement really is.  Make sure you stay off the streets when you hear these guys coming, because they drive at least 80 everywhere.  You can hear their trucks coming from about four miles due to the fact that they have no mufflers.

Another group of cars to watch out for are the punk-mobiles.  These cars are very easy to spot because they have so much paraphernalia  attached to them that they can barely move.  When I say paraphonilia, I mean spoilers, sunroofs, large weird hood ornaments, several coats of black paint, stickers advertising audio equipment, etc.  Actually, that whole slow moving assertation not true.  They move pretty quickly when they really have to, and you can tell when this is happening from another state due to the muffler that sounds like a 747 jet aircraft taking off.  Once these things get moving, they usually have to stop and gas up again, because the souped-up engine gets about thirty feet per gallon.  Thus, they are more of a nuisance than a real serious bother.

Of course, you also have the must-keep-moving guy who drives a car with a net worth of under three-hundred dollars (like a new Kia), and is usually involved with just about everything else in his life rather than watching out for things like people moving about in front of his oncoming vehicle and such.  You can spot these vehicles by looking for erratic driving behavior caused by the driver trying to simultaneously change gears, turn a corner, avoid the pedestrian talking on her cell phone, change the radio station, eat a donut, read the newspaper, shave, and jot notes down for the test that started five minutes ago.  These people are DANGEROUS!  I know, because I am one.

...But really, back to the point.  All of these groups of dangerous drivers don't add up to one of the most horrific and terrifying entities ever to sit behind the wheel of a $32,239.98 Lexus: <strong>THE DADDY'S GIRL</strong>.  They seem to be multiplying and spawning at an exponential rate around here, and walking or driving becomes more frightening every day as a result.

Most people should know what I'm talking about.  These girls stop for nothing.  They talk on the cellular phones without avail.  They have the appearance of being on their way to something very important (United Nations Summit, perhaps), but you suspect that they're really on their way back to their dorm to watch "Trading Spaces".  EVIL!

These girls can be spotted from a distance very easily.  They will not be disgraced enough to be seen behind the wheel of anything less than an outrageously expensive vehicle, for one.  So watch out for all those SUV's, Lexuses, Camaros, and other high-end automobiles.  Next, they are always cellular phones attached to the side of their heads.  These girls cannot survive without them; if you were to remove the telephone, you would essentially kill one of them (just FYI).  Finally, look for obscene finger gestures.  If you are within 90 yards of their vehicles and happen to shoot a quick glance (as in.. what is that Lexus doing driving through the sewage drainage ditch? -or- why is that SUV driving 50 miles per hour on that sidewalk?), you will be immediately reprimanded and reminded by the driver that a girl of her class and saintliness will not be seen driving so incredibly close to a disgraceful being such as yourself.  She will do this through the convenient use of her hands as she is currently talking and cannot tear herself away from whoever is on the other side of the cellular phone connection (another girl in a Camero, most likely) even to selflessly point out your fatal flaw in existing in the same realm as her.

So, walkers, bikers, drivers, beware.  I do not know how things are on other campuses, but I know around here, we are developing a serious problem.  Watch out for those cars.  They watch out for nobody.
