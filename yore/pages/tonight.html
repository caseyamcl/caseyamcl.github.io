Tonight, an assignment was canceled in the Research Methods class I'm taking.

In honor of this momentous occasion, I have decided to go back and pull a piece that I sequenced back in 1999 to publish here.Â  I named it "Atilina" after an imaginary place, and it is a computer-sequenced song that isn't going to win any Grammys, but it's kind of cool in that it meshes together strings, piano, guitar, recorder, saxophone, and other instruments that wouldn't normally be in the same ensemble (all computer generated, of course -- you let me know where I can find a set of instrument players this disparate, and I will have them record it).

Anyhow, the download link is here:
