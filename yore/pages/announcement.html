As part of my web development efforts, I have been working on a PHP-based image management system.  I know there are at least three million out there already, but mine is <strong>better</strong> simply because <strong>I</strong> made it, okay?  In any case, a by-product of development has been the publishing of some of my own pictures on the net.  Feel free to <a href="http://devca.net/personal/album">peruse them</a> at your leisure.  [ Disclaimer: This blog is not liable for any damage to any monitor, printer, or other binary-based output device; nor is it liable for any psychological, visual, or other physical anguish that results from the viewing of these images ]
