I was once told that the years between 21 and 25 fly by at Ludicrous Speed.  Whoever told me that was not kidding.

I feel like I woke up on Monday, and now it's Wednesday.  I started my new job in August, and now it is December.  I started working on this post during Thanksgiving break, and I am just starting to update it now.  That is how busy I have been.  So, in the spirit of an insane schedule, I would like to now offer my commentary on each of the different facets of life that I have been experiencing:

<i>Graduate School:</i>

Somebody must have, a long time ago, decided that a four-year degree was not ridiculous enough for smhucks who like to inflict self-torture upon themselves.  That person must have said, "Hmm. why don't we add three more years of intensive research just to see how long it takes students to go absolutely bananas."  I have not yet started calling myself Wally and attempting to gnaw my left arm off, but I figure that will come closer to the thesis defense.

Along those lines, it seems to me that there is an inverse correlation between (a) being normal and (b) prominence of degree.  I see masters students sitting in a lab staring at a computer at four in the morning only to forget the reason they came in the lab to begin with; I see doctoral students throwing books and throwing temper tantrums at walls for various reasons, such as the printer running out of paper; I see Ph.Ds in the department get into heated battles with each over whose opinion is a more accurate representation of the color of the carpet in the hallway.  It seems the only normal people are the ones with no degree at all.  These people should be running our country, or err umm that doesn't sound quite right...

<i>The "Real" World</i>

So, I get up and come to work at eight everyday, and I leave sometime around five or six.  I go to meetings that involve lots of talk about things like "synergetic awareness," "dynamic responsiveness," and other universal yet meaningless forms of vocabulary designed to take time up and justify leaving one's desk to go talk amongst ourselves.  When I am not meeting, I spend a lot of time sitting in front of a sever looking at screens that say things like:

"Server Error Code 230-3239CTHIS#MEANSNOTHING203-666-NINEDIE: The server has encountered an unexpected error and needs to close.  Also, it needs to use the bathroom and perhaps get a bite to eat, because its blood sugar is rather low."

There is usually somebody else in the room inquiring about how many nanoseconds it will take to fix their computer.

Don't get me wrong; I really like the job.  It's great.  I have lots of autonomous control, get to meet a lot of people that are really high up in the world, i.e. the governor of Florida, the governor's dog (a black laborador retriever), the guy who runs the IT for the capital of Florida, a few IBM executives, every concievable person who works at FSU, and Winston Churchill.  Wait.. scratch that last one.  Also, I get to play with cool toys that most people can't even pronounce, and I get to make up fake technical words and pretend they mean something.

"I am sorry, ma'am, but my staff cannot fix your computer because the internal comustion chamber in the CPU has blown a gasket and we need to rotate the RAM axis in order to get it working.  It will take a few weeks.. and money; lots of money."

<i>Personal Life</i>

I am not sure I have one of these right now.  I have been spending so much time in front of varoius computers, I now glow when you turn the lights off.  Whenever I do get out, i.e. when the power goes out and there is nothing I can do online, I often stand around a stare at how large the world is outside.  Then I go back inside and eat and sleep and do other things that I have been told sustain life.  I think it would be easier if I were able to plug my leg into a 110-volt AC outlet and recharge while I work.

Anyhow, more to come now that the semester is over and I have regained my evenings to do things that I want to do, like.... work.... and stuff.  Maybe I will actually put something remotely useful on this site, since I paid for the domain.

Nah.
