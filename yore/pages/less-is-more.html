A doctor friend of mine from FSU, Dr. Gary Whittenberger, told me once that Organization is the Key to Success.  After thinking about this for oh, about... two years.. I've decided that he's right.  I have not seen as much evidence to prove that he is correct than I have seen evidence to disprove that he is not correct.  In other words, I've seen the anithesis of his claim in action.  The situation that I am refering, to, of course, is my job.

Now, I belittle my job a lot on this website, but since I am firmly of the opinion that (1) belittling my job is one of the primary purposes of this blog, and (2) I thoroughly enjoy belittling my job, especially to a mass audience, there is no stopping me now.

In that regard, I must say that there are sereveral deciduous forests worth of paper at my job.  We have filing cabinet upon filing cabinet upon filing cabinet full of papers that say things like:
<blockquote>"[et. al. One vs. State Dept. of RNSTD] No. 209-A2340932002 2 ;; Patient Ledger O7-623-98 2 -- Patient hit head with fist while attempting to operate bulldozer -- 99999992023480 - 1602 - Date: 08/30/03 - TCH902]" etc...</blockquote>
Of course, nobody actually <em>reads</em> these papers.  As a matter of fact, nobody actually writes these papers either.  They are generated by some giant computer somewhere which has the primary function of coming up with random characters to send to attorneys' offices so that the attorneys can look at it for approximately 0.008 seconds and then have their clerk file it in a stack of papers that would make the Sears Tower look like a paperweight.

The point is, the data on these papers is entered <i>into</i> a computer, stored on a hard drive, printed <i>out</i> of a computer, then mailed for a fee, opened up, looked at (for about 0.008 seconds)... and then a record is entered <i>into</i> a computer, the document is stored in an oversized filing cabinet, and sometimes.. it is scanned <i>back into</i> a computer and then printed <i>out</i> again for whatever reason.  Does nobody see what is going on here!  It's ludicrous!  Nine times out of ten, the paper gets lost and the file clerk spends an hour pulling her hair out in a desperate "office emergency" (note the quotes) search for it.

Paper is obsolete in many situations.  I'm not saying to burn all books and stop producing paper.  I'm saying, if information has been entered into a comptuer to begin with, and it will ultimately end up on another computer somewhere, why waste all the time printing and sending, and losing, and scanning, etc. paper!  As a society, we should be using paper for more appropriate purposes, like printing literature or warnings for products that say things like, "This vacuum cleaner is not for consumption".

If paper is the archenemy of progress and efficiency, then wires are its evil cousin.  I have a partial minature music studio set up in my apartment bedroom, and 90% of it is wires.  If I could get rid of all of them, it would be great.  Those crazy French people have recently come up with a new wireless technology for appliances, called "BlueTooth".  Why are we not using this yet?  Sometimes those wires in my studio get unplugged or twisted up, and I am at a loss for the next twenty minutes trying to untangle the mess.  ...and if my room is a mess, my worksite is the epitome of bad wiring.  The area where we have the computer server looks like the inside of that ship in the movie, "The Matrix".  Sometimes I am afraid to pull a CAT-5 cable out of a socket for fear that the lights in the building will go off or all the fuses in that particular area of town will blow up.

In short, I'm all for wireless stuff and scanners.  Printers are the devil.  Leave the printing to publishing companies.  Personally, I have lived approximately two years without a printer, and, thanks to the embracing of newer technologies by schools that I've attended, I've only had to print a handful of documents on occasion.  Why can't my job figure that out?
