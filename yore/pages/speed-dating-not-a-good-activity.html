title: 'Speed Dating: Not a Good Activity'

I have seen it a lot in the movies lately.  It's apparently a practice where a lot of really desperate people get together and have 80-second dates with each other.  You get herded into a room with a lot of tables.  Girls sit at a table and guys go systematically from table to table, switching off girls every few minutes.  Basically, by the end of the night, every guy has had a very, very short date with every girl in the room.  The goal is to rack of as many second-dates as possible--no wait: The goal is to meet somebody and get a <em>single</em> second date.

Now, is it just me, or is the thought of <em>20 to 40 first dates in a single night</em> not the most terrifying thing possible?  One first date is akward enough.  I mean, consider a few scenarios:

<strong>Movie Night Gone Awkward</strong>
You go to a movie: Nowadays, movie theaters are equipped with those satanic retractable arm rest devices.  These things inject an exponentially high level of tension into first dates.  Hypothetical here:  You and Date enter the movie theater, and then Date turns to you and says something like, "Pick a seat".

So, now you have to not only determine front or back, left side, right side, or whether or not to sit in one of those "double" two-seaters off to the side, but now you also have to make a decision about those arm-rests.  Should you...

... pick seats where the arm-rest is already retracted.
... pick seats where the arm-rest is <em>not</em> retracted?
... sit down and then retract the armrest?
... sit down and un-retract the armrest?

Each of these has its potential negative consequences.  No amount of swauveness can conquer this scneario, my friend.  You're better off just backing out of the date while you're still ahead.  Say that you have to go put more butter on the popcorn and make a mad dash for the next bus.

Or, I guess you could just kinda pick a seat.

<strong>Foot-not-only-in-Mouth-but-Entering-Lower-Intestine-Area</strong>

Say you're on a first date and you say something extremely witty and remarkably clever like: "Not only are poodles great for skeet-shooting, but they also work wonders as tools for unclogging the sink."

...to which Date takes on an expression of horrified shock and stammers, "b-b-but my Fluffy..." and then begins to cry.  This is not good.  So you get nervous, and try to retract the conversation a few steps:

"Uhrr, uhh, I really like poodles a lot.  Gee, yeah.  How about we go look at some poodles right now?  I just can't get enough of those poodles.  They are some swell dogs, they are.  My--uh--Aunt Sally has a poodle.  It's just great..."

"My Aunt Sally had a poodle, too... Then she was hit by a bus."  ...sobs and tears...

Etcetera.  This is an example--just in case you need to know--of a first date that is not going so well.  Fortunately, you can dig yourself out of this hole by using one of those memory erasing deices from that movie, "Men and Black".  Now, go find one of those memory erasing devices; I predict you'll need it at least four times during a typical speed-dating evening.

<i>[Aside: Can you IMAGINE how useful one of those things would be?  YOU: "Did you hear the one about the Jew and the horse?" HER: "I'm Jewish."  YOU: (ZAP HER WITH MEMORY DEVICE) "Do you want to go shopping with me sometime at the Kosher-Mart downtown?"]</i>

<strong>Whoops</strong>
You: "I'll have the Carnivore Special, with extra meat, some turkey gravy, and an extra side of meat with double-ration steak, preferrably veal.  Oh, and steak fries.  Plus a plate of bald eagle."

Date: "I'll have the vegetarian dinner."

You: "Yeah, can I um, change that first order?"


ANYHOW: I end this post with a couple of opening lines--ice breakers, if you will--that you may want to use if you ever find yourself speed-dating:

* Hi, I own a small country.  Want to go out sometime?

* My SAT score was 1460; my GRE score was 1360; my annual gross income is $85,325.00; I only work 5 hours a week; I have a large house on a small island near Bermuda, estates in California, no venereal diseases; and I like children.  What's up?

* I have good news and I have bad news: The good news is I recently got out of prison; the bad news is that I got out through the ventilation shaft and now I'm on my way to Mexico.  So anyhow, those are nice shoes.

* I think I'm in the wrong place.  Is this the Extremely Well-Endowed Men's Club meeting?

Okay, that's all for now.
