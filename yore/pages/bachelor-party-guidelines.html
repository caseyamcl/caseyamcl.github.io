title: 'Bachelor Party Guidelines'

I went to a bachelor party last night, which is fun.  A bachelor party is, of course, the only way to get a bunch of guys to have a party without the promise of any girls potentially present.  There was the usual poker, bad jokes, bar-b-q, and mandatory intoxication of the groom-to-be, as well as lots of making fun of said groom.  Game Over, Artie.  Enjoy your slow death :)

Anyhow, this all-male soirÃ©e implies a very precise and nearly quantifiable set of behavioral rules, including such stipulations like (a) you can't bring any drink to the party that has the word "watermelon", "berry", "lemon", or other girly implication on the label; (b) excessive belching is good; and, (c) there will be stripper jokes (in the case of the absence of strippers, it is necessary to at least refer to their existence).

Of course, there is a corollary to all of this.  Namely, that there exists several activities that are <em>not</em> under any circumstances to be partaken in during a bachelor party.  These include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Spin the bottle</li>
	<li>Sing-A-Long</li>
	<li>Any variety of the game Twister</li>
	<li>Strip poker</li>
	<li>Dancing of any kind, whatsoever, at all</li>
</ul>
These activities, as my friend, <a href="http://www.joshuastarling.com">Josh</a> puts it, will result in the immediate revocation of all present party-goers' <a href="http://www.joshuastarling.com/index.php?p=189">Man-Cards</a>.

Fortunately, we followed all aforementioned guidelines last night, especially the one regarding belching.  We all still have our Man-Cards, as far as we know.
