Here is the speech that imagine that some people will be making to their parents come April.  I wrote it up for something, and I couldn't help but want to post it here:
<blockquote>Mom and Dad,

Today is my big day, and although I would like to say that I am self-made man, I know in my heart that I could never have made it through these past four years without all of the support that you have given me.  Now that I have finally completed my seven-year pursuit of my bachelorâs degree in Art History, I feel it is time to give credit where credit is due and thank those that I care most about for their kind support and understanding.

It was you who drove me and all of my possessions all the way to school from home in that rented full-size U-Haul and helped me move into my first dorm room.  It was hard, and I was nervous being away from home, but thanks to your constant phone calls and that one hundred and twenty dollars worth of groceries you bought for me, I was able to make some new friends quickly.

It was you who provided me with the monetary compensation I needed to get into my first fraternity.  How can I ever thank you for that?  It was an eye opening and character-building experience, to say the least.  I never would have been able to go to all of those co-ed socials, if it werenât for you.

It was you who helped me get treated for that bad case of syphilis that I must have contracted from drinking out of the same glass as somebody or something.  Who knew such a horrible disease could be spread so easily?  Things sure can be tough and dangerous at college, but with you two there to help me out, I knew I could make it through.

It was you who bought me a brand new SUV after some fraternity guys and me sent my old one careening off of the side of Interstate 10.  You understood that boys will be boys, and it was very important for me to have a new Jeep than to be without a vehicle for me and my friends to make use of.  I remember that salesman trying to sell me a used car of all things!  But, you, being the wise parents that you are, would hear nothing of it.  A new car for your son, you said, and you even understood when the roof got torn off when somebody, God knows who, stole it and went joy riding in it one night.

It was you who understood that even the best of us get failing grades in some of our classes.  After all, you once told me that the social aspect of going to college is just as important as the academics, if not more so.  I took your words to heart and have made it my top priority this past four years to get acquainted with as many people as possible.  I learned that there are more important things than going to class, and that in the "real world," all of that academic stuff doesnât really matter, anyways.  Right, dad?

It was you who bought me the plane ticket home when I got stuck in Cancun after that crazy alcohol-related error that occurred with the credit card you gave me.  Who knows how that happened, huh?  I guess they never did catch the guy who stole it and used it to buy all of those rum and vodk-err drinks, did they?  But, you understood completely, and were there, as always, to help me out.

It was you who bailed me out of jail.  You were truly there when I needed you most.

It was you who stood up for me at my academic probation hearings.  Obviously, I need not thank you for that so much for that, being that the school has already honored your generous donation by naming the new Chemistry Lab after you.  Still, though.  You saw me through during my biggest moment of woe and told me to keep trucking, because college is hard, and I knew exactly what you were talking about.

Mom, dad:  I just want to say thank you, and I know you love me and I am glad to be home after all of these years.  College was difficult, and with your help, we all got to experience the joy when I walked across that stage to receive my diploma.  I am going to frame it over my bed upstairs and now that I am home again, I just want to let you know that this time I am here to stay.

What's for dinner?</blockquote>
