title: 'Is College Really Getting Dumber?   An Update'

It's now Monday, and it's time for most of FSU to start sobering up.  For most students, that is a two-to-three day process, which usually involves sleeping through all classes that begin before two in the afternoon.  But that's okay, because instructors these days seem to tailor their agendas to accommodate the drinking needs of most students.  This is good, because alcohol sales really help to boost the gross income levels of Tallahassee, keeping the jobless rate down and the economy stable.  It's no wonder we have at least twenty watering holes up here for students to enjoy seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.  In fact, the city is pushing new initiatives not to discourage underage people from drinking, but instead to discourage them from drinking <em>"too much"</em>.  It's expected that just about everybody who passes through the Campus Gate is an alcohol enthusiast, but the rampant drunkenness sure takes a toll on the well being of our society.

This weekend we had the usual string of alcohol induced activities to recuperate from, which include, but are certainly not limited to, the following:

*Both of FSU fountains got "soaped" (i.e. students poured a box of soap suds into the fountain) this weekend.  Not that this really caused anybody any trouble (in fact, I'm sure the guy that got hired <i>just</i> to clean the fountain every Monday is thankful for the work; plus some of us think the fountain is a waste of our tuition, but enough whining), but nevertheless, it exemplifies the great strides students will take to prove that we are, in fact, stupid.  The fountain has been "soaped" approximately every weekend since the day it was built.  I'm sure when FSU had about five students enrolled, one of them piped up one night--because they really didn't have anything to do on the weekend back then--"Hey!  Let's see what happens when we pour soap in the fountain!"  Ever since, students have been rediscovering on a weekly basis "what happens" when one mixes soap and water together.  As amusing as I'm sure this was for the first ten or twelve decades, watching the soap bubble up and the worker come to clean the whole thing out the next morning has become downright retarded.  We have been kicking a dead horse here, people; the humor has died.  Things do get a lot more wacky with some good ole' alcohol, though.

*Some more creative drunkards this weekend decided to go around bashing in building signs around campus and pulling stop signs out of the ground.  This, as planned, created mass hysteria on campus and made them very popular with the ladies for being such rebels.  Okay, neither of those two things happened, but they did prove that they could break things.  So can Osama Bin Laden, but he's not too popular these days.  My guess is that they successfully killed off a majority of their braincells, and needed to destroy something to get out that "extra energy" built up.

*I casually observed a student today, in a search for a parking spot, drive his or her SUV over a parking lot barrier, through a sewage drainage ditch, and directly into a parking lot barrier of a completely different lot, knocking the barrier into the roadway, which caused a major portion of the parking lot to become blocked off.  The student, being an educated and ethical decent human being, got out of the car, and proceeded to move the barrier back to its proper location.  Yeah, right; you can fertilize the lawn with that one.  Whoever it was simply kept driving, found a parking spot, and, I'm sure, promptly forgot about the incident.  I'm sure it's the "University's fault" for perpetuating this kind of behavior, because there aren't enough parking spots.  That student will probably grow up to sue a lot of people.

This whole post, of course, is in response to an article appropriately published in the school's newspaper regarding drinking problems at an even bigger <a href="http://www.osu.edu">university</a>.  You can read it <a href="http://www.fsunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/10/06/3f808d7033820">here.</a>
