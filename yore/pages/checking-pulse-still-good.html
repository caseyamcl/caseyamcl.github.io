My humble apologies for the lack of content here this past month.  I arrived in New York City on November 22, arrived back in Tallahassee on November 27th, and have not stopped moving since, except on Sunday when I watched 'Gettysburg', a four-hour movie detailing the Battle of Gettysburg... talk about long!

Good things are happening this December, though.  I have come a long way since [link]two years ago[/link] in my Christmas-shopping American-consumerism, must-buy-buy-buy activities.  I no longer fear the mall, simply because I no longer go there anymore.  I bought all of my gifts off of Amazon.com, which necessitated me traveling approximately 30 feet to my landlord's office where all the gifts had been shipped, pre-wrapped.  The Internet is a good thing.

Update on the car: it has been running fine for over a month now, despite what my [link]former mechanic[/link] says.  Guess the automotive apocalypse will have to wait (maybe not too long -- I'm taking the car to Pennsylvania next week).

I also got a job--again.  As if I didn't have enough work to do, I decided to test out the self-employment consulting world.  I have a few clients, and things are going well, albeit, I was out until 11 p.m. last night putting together proposals and recommendations.

Also, at work, we have decided to purchase some <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4100/index.jsp">new Sun servers!</a>  [Geek Moment]I'm so happy; it's like Christmas![/Geek Moment] ...wait, it is Christmas.  [More geekdom]These things are, as my IT friend put it, mad awesome; 1U; Dual Core; vmWare; etc.[/More geekdom]

Happy holidays; that's all the news for now.
