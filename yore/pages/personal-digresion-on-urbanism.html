I moved into town last year.  I mean, really into town.  I live four blocks from the Capitol and one block from FSU.  My apartment overlooks Jefferson Street.  This is different than roughly 98% of Tallahassee's population, who live in suburbs ten miles from town on little windy roads behind giant gated walls in communities with the names of whatever geographical features they displaced: "Winding Widge", "Buck Lake", "Pine Forest".

Things are pretty good where I live, except for the "psuedo-city" environment, and I use the creative terminology because this is Tallahassee--not exactly a thriving metropolis.  The noise and culture of a non-Homeowner's Association regulated environment exists though.  Consider the the things I have to try to sleep through on weeknights:

<b>11:30 p.m.</b> - Garbage truck pulls up to and empties <em>every single</em> dumpster in a three block range.  Beeping and other garbage-truck-related noises are emitted for 20 minutes

<b>11:45 p.m.</b> - Bwwwaaaaammmpppp - Train #1 rolls through town blaring horn.

<b>12:00 a.m.</b> - Girl on cell-phone stands on balcony outside for 20 minutes ("she did?  ... no she DIDN'T ... she <em>DID?</em> ... no, she DIDN'T ...")

<b>12:15 a.m.</b> - Bwaaaaammp Bwaaaamp Bwaammp - Train #2 rolls through town

<b>12:30 a.m.</b> - Next-door neighbor's dog spots something moving besides itself: Bark! Barkbark!  Barkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbark...

<b>12:45 a.m.</b> - "...she did? ... no she DIDN'T ... she <em>DID?</em> ... no, she DIDN'T..."

<b>1:00 a.m.</b> - Potbelly's Bar down the street hosts some "local talent"  Horrible noises ensue.

<b>1:15 a.m.</b> - Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamp - Train #3

<b>1:30 a.m.</b> - Local White-Boy comes cruising up to stoplight in pI3med-0uT Honda which causes about 180 decibels of Linkin Park to shake my windows.

<b>1:45 a.m.</b> - Bwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamp - Train #4

<b>2:00 a.m.</b> - Bars Close - Underage sorority girls begin to stagger back to their houses, twenty-five sheets to the wind... lots of girlish screaming for about an hour.

<b>2:15 a.m.</b> - Train #234092343209 (or so it seems)

Aside from minor adjustments you have to make living in a more urban area, the change has basically been great.  Living in America, I am still tethered to my car in many ways, but I have more freedom than most people do.  To get to work, it's a six minute walk.  Downtown--six minutes the other way.  I know my neighbors, because I see them often (we don't use garage door clickers to hide from each other).

I spend much less in gas (I fuel up about every 4 weeks), and although most everything has moved out of the city and onto the mega-roads with big-box-marts that encircle the city (i.e. I can't buy a bottle of vitamins without a car trip--I've tried), I still have more options when it comes to transit than most people.

There's a lot to be said to actually living <em>in</em> a city, and not just around it, despite the trains.
