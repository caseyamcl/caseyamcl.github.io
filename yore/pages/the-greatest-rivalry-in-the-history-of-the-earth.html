<div align="left">...And I'm not talking about a rivalry between the two species.  They could care less about each others' existence.  Dogs can go sniff each others' butts while cats can claw sofas and such.  They've gotten along pretty well for the past million years.  However, dog OWNERS and cat OWNERS... now there's a problem.  I've known couples to split up over this infelicitous difference of opinion between which furry critter makes a better companion.</div>
<div align="left">I have decided to address this issue in a very objective, fair, impartial, and dignified post by saying that dogs are definitely better.  A dog is a man's (or woman's; let's not be exclusive, here) best friend, and as is fairly obvious, this particular species did not obtain the title by sitting around playing with string all day.

I want to start off by saying dogs are great.  They're useful and friendly, and they really appreciate their owners, which they let you know.  If you have a dog, next time you go home, don't take for granted the warm, euphoric welcome that you get just for <em>walking in the door</em>.  Dogs are generally so elated in seeing you come home, they almost faint.  If you get two dogs, it's like having your own personal fan club.  Contrast this with cats... "Oh, look it's that other two-legged thing that lives here.  I think I'll saunter off somewhere."  That's about the most I've ever gotten out of a cat.  I suspect that my experiences aren't unique.

As I mentioned, dogs are also useful in many ways.  For one, they get rid of things like squirrels, rabbits, frogs, mice, and other rodents whose presence might upset the natural balance of order in the universe.  I've even known a dog to attempt to tackle an alligator on somebody's front lawn... but that's another story.  Dogs have a tried-and-true method of chasing whatever it is that shouldn't be in your domain up a tree or out of its--and your--territory.  But that's not all!  This furry helper doesn't just chase the animal off and assume the rodent is out if its (the dog's) hair.  Of course not.  Your four-legged friend sticks around for sometimes <em>hours</em> at a time and makes sure that the evil being doesn't come back by barking at it until it gets so annoyed that it falls out of the tree, dead, or it avoids your yard forever with all caution.

Then there's ...cats.  What do they do when they encounter a squirrel, rabbit, frog, lizard, or anything else that looks organic and small?  They kill it and drag it inside your house to the foot of your bed!  Some experts say that this is a sign of affection.  I digress.  I think cats get a big kick out of annoying you by leaving dead, smelly rodents in awkward places.  It's kind of a game cats play among each other.  They get together at the end of the week and discuss, in cat language, who psyched their owners out the most.  ("Yeah, I left a dead roach to the middle of my owner's pillow." ... "Oh yeah?  Well I dragged a dead, three-pound rat into a dinner party.")  Now tell me, who are the real suckers in this situation?

Speaking of affection, it's completely obvious that dogs are much better at forming a bonding relationship with humans than cats are.  Most dogs I meet think their owners are akin to Greek Gods and must be protected, lavished with attention, and entertained.  In return, they only ask for food and air-conditioning.  It's a relationship of mutual respect and equal effort.  Contrastingly, a cat shows you affection by jumping in your lap and trying to gouge different body parts out with its claws.  Most "affection" from cats is purely fake, in this author's humble opinion, as the act of "affection" is simply a ploy get you to scratch their posterior section due to a species-wide itch that occurs there.  Is that not gross?

Conclusively speaking, I strongly believe that I have just obliterated twenty minutes notating this senseless debate into a blog, because we all know who Man's Best Friend <em>really</em> is.  I just thought I'd clear it up for you.  Consider this a public service announcement.</div>
