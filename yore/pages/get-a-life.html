Hello, friends.

I was going to apologize for not posting very well in the past few months, but after reviewing my archives, I've noticed that a good 50 to 60 percent of my postings start with some apology droning on about how I've been a bad blogger and providing some excuse about why I haven't posted, and how sorry I am, blah-blah-blah...

So, instead of apologizing, I'll say this: I haven't posted in a while, and if you don't like it, you can just lick my foot and go get a life, because I didn't want to!  So there.

Yes, it's true that some people have asked me why I haven't posted, which is very flattering, but I submit to those people the fact that <em>not</em> writing a post is actually easier than writing a post!  So, I've just been doing that.

Okay... all of that aside, I'm feeling in the Christmas--and therefore loquacious--mood, so I will proceed to enlighten you with content that I will bestow freely upon you, the loyal reader.

...and if you don't like it, you can just lick my foot and go get a life, because I don't care!  So there.

So exactly what have I been doing besides updating this website?  Well, sad to say.. not much.

Work has been tiring, so my Mondays have consisted of coming home, opening up a bucket of Edy's, and turning on Channel 57 to watch television specials with titles like <em>"Modern Marvels: The Science of Glue"</em>, or <em>"Exploring the Ancient Dirt Mines of Central America"</em>.  Yes, I know: pretty lame.  I can recall many a conversation:

<strong>Friend:</strong> "Hey Casey, do you want to go out tonight?"

<strong>Me:</strong> "No, not now man.  '<em>Glue</em>' is on!"

Now that I have published that sad fact on the Internet, I am going to go sulk in the corner, or perhaps see if that show about the assembly of cardboard boxes is airing tonight.

...and if you think that I am boring, then you can just lick my foot and go get a life, because-----okay, I'll stop.

Adios for now!
