I came face-to-face with a force not to be reckoned with by the weak and faint of heart.  It was a difficult battle, but in the end it was I who was victorious, and it was I who triumphed.  It was me versus the Copy Machine, and guess who won the war...

You see, the battle has been raging on for about a year and a half now, ever since it and I came in contact with each other.  It must have been a comment I made about how old and dilapidated it was that made it so angry with me.  Ever since then, it has been eating my papers, crumpling up my documents, shutting itself off, and generally trying t make my professional life a miserable experience.  I have lost just about every battle that I have had with that copier.

Until Today.

Today, it went too far.  Today, the copier crossed the line it knew it was not to cross.  Today was judgment day for it.  I feel no remorse or guilt, because the copier brought its own death upon itself.  Nobody spits toner on Casey Andrew McLaughlin (more than ten or eleven times) and lives to hear about it.

It started off as a normal day at work.  I was tired, my boss was gone, and I was just doing my thing when I got the call that a package of papers about an inch-and-a-half thick needed to be copied twice.  The copy person was out (as she often is), and I was the only one willing to stand up to the doomsday machine; so I marched into battle.  Almost instantly, the copier was on the defensive and ready to reject and destroy any copy job that I was going to give it.  I took the stack of papers and started working my way through the pile, when about one-tenth of the way through, the copier refused to perform its sole duty in life, which is of course, copy papers.

<a title="Evil Copy Machine!" class="imagelink" href="/yore/images/a>so,igotupsetandstartedrandomlypressingbuttons.it's a tactical maneuver that may seem a bit obtuse, but it usually works on the miserable machine in question.  Well, it usually works.  Today, however, it made a key mistake that cost it its life: The copier spat toner out all over me.

...And not just all over me... all over the walls, all over the table, all over the floor, and primarily, all over its own inner workings.  That made me mad, and let us just say that, the long story made short is, I was on the phone an hour later with the guy from the copy machine store, putting in an order for them to come get the machine.  ...And I quote the copy salesman: "Well, we're gonna bring the new one in on Monday or Tuesday.. from the sounds of it, looks like we're just going to junk that old one... throw it in the garbage heap."

The garbage heap!  Haha!  You may have won most of the battles, Copy Machine, but I won the War!!
