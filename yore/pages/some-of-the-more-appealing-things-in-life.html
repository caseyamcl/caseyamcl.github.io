I happened to be looking at my site statistics the other day, and I noticed some of the search queries people have used to inadvertently stumble upon this site.

Some of those included such phrases as <b>"letter of apology for bad behavior"</b> and <b>"fraternity step dancing animated"</b>.  Let's not forget the ever so nefariously famous (with me)<b>"snot food"</b>.  You <i>know</i> that I was, within seconds, doing my own <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=snot+food">search</a> for the last of those examples through Google.  Sure enough, in following this mystery-searcher's footprints, I found all kinds of interesting information related to the substance we so affectionately refer to as snot.

Some of the more relevant search results included:

<a href="http://chemistry.about.com/c/ht/02/12/How_Fake_Snot1039306459.htm">How to Make Fake Snot</a> - This may be very useful, indeed.  Say you are on a date, and the date is not going well.  In fact, the person that you are currently sitting across the table from during your dinner is the anti-thesis of charm, attraction, wit, or anything else remotely desirable in a "significant other".  You wish to end the date, but you can't think of any good way to do it without putting your true opinions of that person on the spot.  Presto!  Out with the fake snot (a good handful should suffice)!  If the other person doesn't run screaming from the table, mortified beyond belief, there is probably not much you can do about the situation.

<a href="http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Snot_20Eating_20Bacteria">Snot Eating Bacteria</a> - If ever I begin to doubt the usefulness of science, I need not but click over to this site and read the insights of whoever wrote this.  Forget cold medicines; if you have a runny nose, just inject yourself with some good ol' fashioned genetically engineered snot-eating bacteria!  I shudder to think of the possibilities that exist when this line of thinking is allowed to propagate, and worse, be applied to issues that society faces.

<a href="http://www.uaf.edu/seagrant/NewsMedia/00ASJ/10.19.00_Snot.html">The House that Snot Built</a> - In a pinch but need a place to stay?  Have no friends who are willing to let you in?  Just use snot!  If you don't have enough of your own, I'm sure some philanthropic others will be happy to lend you some.

Okay, before I begin to sound like I am completely obsessed with this grossology (which I most certainly am not!  No really... I'm not!), I will cease this discussion.  However, if, for some strange demented reason, you find this post enlightening, I encourage you to get out there and do your own search for booger-related materials.

Sites like these, existing on the world's largest and most diverse information medium, always remind me of how far we've come technologically speaking, but how, when it all comes down ot it, we are still inescapably human.
