I want to personally thank my friends, and those I don't know, in the FSU University Philharmonia for a great, FREE performance on Thursday night, October 2nd.  I also want to recognize conductor Alexander Jimenez for his ability to walk on and off the stage many, many times.

I understand that it's a long-established tradition for the conductor to walk off the stage, the audience to continue aplauding, and the conductor to walk back on the stage, but hasn't it gotten a little nuts?  After the performance, he walks off the stage, the audience applauds (per the general established routine), and the conductor walks back on.  That's all fine and well and good, but this happened approximately seven times on Thursday night!  In theater performances, all we ever expected the audience to do if they really liked the performance was to stand up.  It was quick, easy, and we all got to go home before the turn of the next millenia.  With the symphony orchestra, the conductor has to walk the cumulative distance back-and-forth of approximately 2.43 miles before the show can be officially ended.

I have to say, though, that the whole chrade was pretty funny, as it had my friend Katie and I snorting snot out our noses after the fifth consecutive cycle of applaud-walking.  It's like he was doing laps at the gym.  I guess he deserved the right to walk around a lot, though.  The performance was exceptional.  In fact, I'm sure that some audience members, based on the time they spent applauding, would have been glad to have given any of the orchestra members a ride home on their backs after the performance.

....and speaking of absurd applausitory (new word) things that happen during symphony orchestras, the conductor also seemd to enjoy shaking hands with select violin players on the front row of the orchestra and rubbing other particular orchestra members' shoulders as he strolled by them to and from the conductor's podium (again and again and...).  After a while, I fully expected him to start slapping players' rear ends when he walked by and grabbing some of the priettier musicians by both shoulders and kissing them on both cheeks.

Oh yeah.. and the musicians!  They had the little inside game of stomping their feet on the stage whenever the conductor would saunter back to the conductor's podium from his hiding place backstage.  I almost expected them to start waving their arms and making monkey noises.  It was good fun, I have to say.

I predict that pretty soon, the audience is going to be handed nerf guns at the door so we can play hit-the-conductor when he walks back and forth across the stage.  ...plastic nerf bullets of appreciation...  Or we could throw water balloons at him with messages written in magic marker that say "Congratulations!" and "Great Performance!" and "I hope this doesn't hit you in the Eye!"
The way I see it, it would be great fun if the orchestra members dumped a bucket of Gatorade on the conductor's head after the performance.  Fans could paint their bodies before the performance.  I can just see a bunch of drunk guys in the fifth row with the leters "G-O-J-I-M-E-N-E-Z" painted on their stomachs.  Then, after the last note, everybody could riot through the streets in our tuxedos and three piece suits setting things on fire and overturning vehicles to show the world our excitement of how great the performance was.

I bet it would be on CNN.
