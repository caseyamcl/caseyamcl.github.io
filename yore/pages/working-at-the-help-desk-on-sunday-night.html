The scene:  There are three of us sitting in a big, mostly vacant lab room.  The web devopment guy is silently clicking away and letting out an occasional sigh in hopes of getting a new system online before the night is over.  The asian lab coordinator is motionless and staring blankly at her laptop computer screen as she has been for the past three hours; I have to wonder if she's looking at anything or if the computer is even turned on.

The action:  Something miraculous happened tonight.  I actually recieved an e-mail.. from a student, none the less.  Okay, well it was actually a computer generated error message.  I'm convinced that if the school annhilated in a nuclear blast, and the entire city of Tallahassee was obliterated, we'd still be getting computer generated error messages from the server.  But, in any case, it means that there is a student out there, somewhere, besides me, who is (a) not watching the Superbowl and (b) working, or at least pretending to do work.  Way to go, whoever you are.  Too bad about that error message that you got from the computer, though; I ought to be helping you resolve it, since that is, in fact, my job.  But, in any case, good luck!
