Okay, so anybody who actually comes here and takes a look at this site is probably wondering exactly what in the world is going on.  I have only a few moments, so I will briefly explain what's happening.

Question One:  This used to be allCasey.blogspot.com; now it's devca.net/blog.  What's up with that?

Answer One:  I have purchased my own webspace!  So, instead of hosting my weblog on the advertising-based blogspot.com, I chose to move the whole thing over to the new space.  I <em>am</em> after all, a developer, so I really ought to show that I know how to do this kind of stuff.

Question Two:  What in the world does "devca" mean?  Why is the site address "devca.net" ?

Answer Two:  Well, it really isn't supposed to be an acronym for anything.  It's just a domain name that I found short, easy to remember, and kind of technical, but not too technical.  These things are important, you know.  If you really want to match it up with something symbolic, then I suppose it <i>could</i> stand for "DEVeloped by CAsey", but that's stretching it...

Question Three:  ?#$)#(!  The facade keeps changing!

Answer Three:  I know, I know.. The first template I had, in my opinion, sucked.  The second one was cool, but kind of red, but I decided to use it anyways.  This latest template was developed by yours truly.  The only reason I made the switch this time was that I eventually plan to have a full-fledged, one-hundred percent, total "real" professional site running on devca.net, and this template should match the rest of the site pretty well.  You shall see in the future....

Alright, that's all for now!  On to some real content, but for now I gotta Jet!  Ciao
