Driving to the store to pick up a frozen pizza for later consumption is an innocent enough thing to do.  It was on this voyage last night that I noticed a little light on the dashboard in the shape of a battery.  Everything worked and sounded fine, except for the little battery light ominously staring at me as if to say, "your car may seem fine, Casey, but hidden under the hood is a small bomb in the shape of an Eveready battery. Muwhaha. Now stop putting 87 octane in me or I will blow up!"

So, I turned the voltmeter on, and it told me that my charge was 12.5v, which seemed all good and well to me, but I decided to check what that meant just to be safe.  Good thing I did; turns out that my alternator was dead, and my car had the potential to roll to a stop just about anywhere--with my luck, it would be in a Burger King drive-thru.

I decided, ignoring the little voices in my head telling me not to change the alternator myself, to change the alternator myself.  The plan was as follows:
<ul>
	<li><strong>7:00</strong> - Pick up my tools</li>
	<li><strong>7:10</strong> - Drive to Anna's; jack car up; remove tire</li>
	<li><strong>7:30</strong> - Print out diagrams and instructions</li>
	<li><strong>7:40</strong> - Remove alternator</li>
	<li><strong>8:00</strong> - Take alternator to Discount; redeem lifetime warranty; get new alternator</li>
	<li><strong>8:30</strong> - Install new alternator</li>
	<li><strong>8:40</strong> - Put car back together; drive home and eat some pizza</li>
</ul>
Even the best-laid plans can go awry.  Considering that statement, it's no doubt that horribly-laid plans, such as this one, would, in all probability, go completely down the toilet, end washed up on a highway, get run over by an Oldsmobile several times, and then eaten by a reptile (speaking metaphorically).

There were a couple of things that I had failed to take into account.  Namely, (1) my tools are pretty lame; I bought my ratchet set for $10.00 at a discount store; (2) despite past efforts, I have never actually successfully removed the alternator off of this car; (3) it was dark outside; and, (4) I did not really have a place to actually work on the car.  Ahh, but common sense aside, I decided that it would be a capital idea to go ahead and do it anyways.

At 12:30 a.m., after four trips to various stores to buy tools, me being covered in grease literally from head to toe, one incident of locking keys in the car, a discovery of the fact that the store my alternator was warrantied at doesn't exist anymore, four hours of my friend Anna trying to convince me to let a "professional" do it, and approximately $120.00--plus several layers of skin, I decided that <em>maybe</em> I would take it in, mostly because I was seeing double by that time.

So, we put it back together, checked the tire, checked the connection, checked the bolts, and checked the sepertine belt.  It all seemed like it would work pretty well.  I started the car, approved of the noises the engine was making in a thoughtful manner, went and slept, and picked it up in the morning.  Driving to the mechanic, I noticed the steering was tight and the temperature was climbing steadily into that cautionary little red zone on the meter.  Red is never good, so I mentioned these two things to the mechanic.

Six hours elapsed, and I got a call.  It was the mechanic, who was excitedly telling me that the car was doomed unless I spent $1200.00 now!  Not later; NOW!!  The guy on the line sounded very apocalyptic.  He kept throwing around phrases like "failed combustion test", "excessive leakage", and "quick death".  He said I needed to kick the guy who worked on my car before him square in the butt for not alerting me to the extremely weak serpentine belt.  I didn't bother to tell him who that person was.

In any case, I told him to hold off with the death and $1200 stuff, put the new alternator in, charge me whatever overpriced amount he wanted and give me the bloody car back.  He did so with one of those, "don't come crying to me when you hit a tree and your car becomes a 20 kilo-ton mass of exploding gas" looks in his eye.

So, tonight, I took my father's advice, and spent a little quality time with Car, taking it out into the forest and back.  Upon doing so for two hours, I noticed no cracked engine block symptoms, no excessive overheating, no strange noises coming from the engine, and no steering difficulties.  Nothing apocalyptic happening.  It was, in a literary sense, pretty anticlimactic.

So, after all of this, I have made a decision: if I am ever going to the store, innocently looking for a frozen pizza to make, and a dashboard light shaped like anything whatsoever comes on, I am going to drive the car into the nearest river and buy a horse.
