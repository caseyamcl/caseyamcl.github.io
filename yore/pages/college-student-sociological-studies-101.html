There are many guys who wear bow-ties and work in brick buildings that agree upon the fact that my generation (20-somethings of the early 21st century) can be referred to as the "connected generation", given all of our new technology toys.

On paper, who could argue?  We've <em>all</em> got mobile phones now, and we use them constantly.  When we're not on the phone, we might be on the Internet, sending synchronous messages back and forth through IM.  Or, we could be updating our weblogs, sharing with the world the wonders of what we feel like at the moment (A: miserable, B: depressed, C: lonely, or D: tired).  Or... we're in front of the television, supposedly absorbing what's going on in the world at large.  Cool conceptual tools like RSS, PodCasts, and phone text-messaging allow us to share information through entirely new channels.  E-mail lets us share thoughts privately, and language-translation tools are beginning to bridge the gaps between different tounges of the World.

Yet, I argue, my generation consists of some of the most detached group of people on the planet.  We are simply not used to social interaction anymore.  In general, it is a special case when a student can communicate in public, or, in many cases, in private, effectively.  Compared to some of our prior counterparts, we get low marks in vocabulary and in serendipidous interaction.

I have a few ideas as to why we are so:

1. Cars - (My unofficial nemsis in many regards) - The past fifty years of development within our society has been built to facilitate our cars, not us.  Therefore, we spend, on average, a large amount of time in our cars, shielded by six planes of glass and a lot of steel/plastic from anybody else who happens to be going somewhere (<em>anywhere</em>, really -- how many places do you walk to these days?)  We grew up travelling everywhere in cars.

2. Television - Most of us, as our primary means of entertainment, live vicariously through our television sets.  We all have our favorite shows, and we watch, on average, 42 hours of television a week.  Most television watching is not centered around news, world events, or education, but instead cheap entertainment, such as reality TV, repeitive sitcoms, and sensational/unrealistic dramas.  Let's not even mention the mental effects of watching hours of commercials daily.  Bah...

3. Lack of Readership - Let's face it, given the more readily available and instantly gratifying forms of entertainment--music and radio--the work that goes into reading a book is more often turned down in favor of less mind-taxing alternatives.  We don't get the opportunity to tune our own writing skills by reading others' works, nor do we expand our vocabulary much.  Most of what is on TV is dicated at about a seventh-grade level.

4. iPods, Nanos, Zens, Walkmans, etc. - Apple predicts that a small majority of college students across America now own an iPod.  The number continues to grow rapidly, and that isn't even taking into account the numerous competitors out there floating around in use.  We can now entertain ourselves anywhere and everywhere.  We can also tune out the world around us.  There is no better way to indicate that you don't want to interact with others than to stick headphones in your ears.  It's a personal conceptual bubble of privacy.  Its also a method of constantly paying attention to something besides one's own thoughts.

5. The Internet - Why risk social interaction in-person when there are less personal means of communication?  Computers provide many new communication channels and means of interaction, but these should not be used as alternatives to real, live social interaction.

6. Mobile Phones - These always provide a way out of just about any situation imaginable that might qualify as difficult.  A meeting with the boss; a nerve-racking first date; an audition gone sour.  Virgin Mobile even marketed, a few years back, a phone that could be programmed to automatically call itself, making it seem like you have an important call coming in, just so you could dodge out of an uncomfortable situation quickly.  We live in a society that holds phone conversation to a standard of greater importance than human-to-human interaction.

We need to take more risks and put ourselves out there just a little bit more.  Do something scary once in a while.  Talk to a stranger.  These little distraction gizmos are nice; but don't let them alter your life in such a way that you become a recluse.
