Today's waste-time-at-work post will consist of a REVIEW of a brand new website that dubs itself the "Unofficial Homepage for Florida State" University.  It's a place where students can go on the web to avoid anything acedemic.

You can check it out here:  <a href="http://www.noleweb.com">www.noleweb.com</a>

The site does offer some great services that students can take advantage of.  These include the "Need A Ride" section, that looks useful, although I really can't figure out what it does or how to use it; the "Professor Ratings" section, which allows students to make sure that a particular professor's standards are low enough to faciliate an easy 'A' before signing up for the class; a book exchange for those students looking to sell textbooks to other students; and a "Ticket Trader" section, because isn't that what we're all here for anyhow -- free football game admission?

With all of these useful services, it's no wonder the site is so popular.  Actually, none of them are getting used very much, but the message boards are.  NoleWeb offers a great forum for higher-education students to share ideas and toss around their thoughts.  Some threads I ran across include "I'm in the mood to get drunk", "Rain sucks", "my dog just out-drank my roommate", "I GET WASTED TOO MUCH", and "Beer Pong!", among others.  Of course, with all of these intriguing topics, I was compelled to explore more.

I clicked on <a href="http://www.noleweb.com/message_topic.aspx?topic=182">'yea, you can IM her'</a> to see what other people here like to discuss:
<blockquote>User one:  "jzogirl: it already is burning cause u r a JEW" (to which she added:) "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH", and "catholic roommate..."
User Two: "I'm talking to one of your roommates...hah."
User One: "haha super"
User Two: "she'll prolly yell at me"
User One: "she wont yell...she never does; hahahhaa"</blockquote>
I'm glad they shared that enlightening conversation with us.

NoleWeb also offers exciting, proactive stories, with topics like "How to get a Hot Girlfriend" and "Isn't this site Great?", and a humor column whose author, when asked by fans when he would post a new column, cussed out the readers.  I'm glad to see such interesting, thoughtful individuals representing higher education.

There are also many other features of this fun, interactive, and useful web portal for FSU students, so I strongly encourage all of you to get out there and explore, use, and join in the beer-bashing, football-loving, education-avoiding fun.

It'll help me too; I need as little intellectual competition as possible when I graduate.
