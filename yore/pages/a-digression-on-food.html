Every so often, something happens that more or less reasserts my hypothesis that God does indeed have a crazy sense of humor.  Today, I was once again reminded of my theory.

This morning, the message was clear: "Stop eating so much fast food";  and it happened with a phone call concerning a particular restaurant, which, for reasons of liability, we shall refer to here simply as "Restaurant X":

Me: "Good morning; Law Office; this is Casey; how can I help you?"

Person:  "Yeah, I need a consultation on something."

Me:  "Okay, why don't you tell me what happened."

Person:  "Excuse me?  I can't understand you."

Me:  "Oh, you'll have to excuse me.  I'm eating my breakfast while I'm talking to you.  Busy day, you know?  I said that you should tell me what happened, and we'll see what we can do for you."

Person:  "Oh, okay.  No problem.  Well, last Monday, I got off work for lunch, and I decided to go to Restaurant X and get some food."

"Okay.  Did you slip-and-fall in the restaurant?" (I asked, because we get a lot of slip-and-fall cases)

"No, I came down with a severe case of food poisoning."

--Pause--

It is at this point that I just happened to glance over at the plastic cup I was drinking out of.  It had been purchased by myself this morning, and it was full of tea.  On the side of the cup, imprinted on the plastic, was the logo: "Restaurant X".

Me:  "You got who--wha--what?"

Person:  "Food poisoning.  Severe case of it.  I had to be transported to the hospital."

I abruptly stopped eating my breakfast burrito.

Me:  "Ummm.. what exactly did you order, might I ask?"  (By this time my voice was becoming less audible)

Person:  "Even though it was lunch, I got a breakfast burrito, since they were still serving them."

Me:  "Uh-huh"  (I was now clutching my heart in a protective manner)

Person:  "...Sir?"

Me:  "Go on.."

"Okay, well I ate the burrito, and I noticed that some of the meat was undercooked and made me feel uneasy, but that wasn't the big problem."

"What was the big problem?"

"Well, it was the drink.. I got a tea, and apparently, something feel in the drink machine or something, because when I was drinking it, something large got sucked up through the straw and I nearly choked on it.  When I opened the cup to look inside, I noticed there was some kind of debris at the bottom.  So, I threw it out."

"But, that was it..  You didn't have any problems after that?"

"No.  I got really ill that night."

"With what?" (By this time, my voice was faint and squeaky.  I was sweating)

"Well, at around 8:00 p.m. that night, I got a really bad stomach ache."

"Uh-huh?"

"Then, I started to vomit uncontrollably."

"Vomit uncontrollably?!"

"Then, the diarrhea came on."

<i>"The diarrhea came on?!?"</i>

"Then, I got insomnia and a headache all night long.  I didn't sleep at all."

<b><i>"No sleep!?!?!?!!  Insomnia???"</i></b> (I was now shaking in a spastic manner)

"There was blood in my stool."

--Pause--

Me: (Nonchalantly) "That's gross."

Person:  "You're right.  Sorry I mentioned it."

Me:  "That's okay.. go on."

"The next day at work, I thought I felt better, but then I fainted."

Me: (back to being traumatized) <b><i><u>"YOU FAINTED????!!!??"</u></i></b>

"Yes, and they rushed me to the emergency room, and I woke up in the hospital."

By this time, I was attempting to choke all of the substance out of my stomach through sheer coughing force.

Me: "Cough..accccccckkkkkk.. coughcough..accckk"

Person:  "...sir?"

Me:  "Coughh..acck... <i>go on</i>...cough..ackk.."

Person:  "They diagnosed me with severe gastritis, or something like that.  I'm not even allowed to go back to work."

Me:  ...silence...

Person: "Do you think I have a case?"

Me:  "I don't want to die!!"

Person:  "Sir? ... Sir?"

Person: "...Sir?..."

Person: "... Sir, stop sobbing."

Person: "...sir? ... sir?  Okay, sir, I'll call you back."

Well, okay, maybe that was a <i>slight</i> dramatization, but you can definitely observe the distress I was in.  I mean, evidentally, I was eating the breakfast burrito of death and drinking the doomsday tea for breakfast this morning!  Would that not inflict fear in you, also?

However, I am happy to state that apparently, all that worry was for nothing.  As it turns out, I am perfectly fine and in good health, and still chugging along good as normal, which just goes to show you-
