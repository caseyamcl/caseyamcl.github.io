For my post-Independence Day post, I feel compelled to make a tribute to our country and the fact that we serve food here that doesn't stare back at you from your plate; the fact that our domestic airline companies are only partially incompetent; and, of course, that we use currency which doesn't look like it works only in an arcade.

You see, my brother and I were recently in Spain, which we enjoyed some parts of, were awed by other parts, tolerated yet other parts, and tried as hard as we could to get away from the remaining parts.  In all, though, our time in the country was generally positive, and we both learned a lot about international travel, cultural differences, language, and what the inside of many, many Catholic cathederals look like.

It was getting out of the country that proved to be a problem.  Both of us should have seen trouble brewing when, on the way into the country a week earlier, our airline booked our seats as "39A" and "39B" on an airplane with only 20 rows.  The real trouble, however, was when we were on our way back out of Spain.  For the record, I'll relay the story as best I can remember (it's pretty much the full version so it's kind of long):

Here's the plan as it stood on Sunday night from our lodgings in Seville:

1.  Get a train from Seville to Madrid in the morning
2.  Catch the Metro from the Madrid train station to the Madrid airport that day
3.  Get on our flight from Madrid to London-Gatwick in the afternoon
4.  Stop overnight in Gatwick, buy some flake bars, have a good sleep in a hotel nearby the airport.
5.  Get on Delta flight back to the U.S. on Tuesday morning, bright and early.
6.  Arrive US and enjoy something either grilled, smoked, or bar-b-qued from Texas.

Here's what really happened:

1.  We caught the train from Seville to Madrid, but only after some consternation about us not being able to get on any train that would put us back in Madrid before our flight took off.  Turns out that this issue took care of itself, however, and after my "final shower" in Seville, we were on the train to Madrid.

2.  In Madrid, the Metro ride wasn't half bad either, with subway cars filled only to capacity, and not <em>beyond</em> capacity, as we had experienced the week prior.

3.  Here's where the real fun begins.  We got the airport pretty early and discovered that, as always, our supposedly little-known discount airline had the longest line in which we waited for about an hour.  Having eaten only train food since the prior night, Jake and I were not happy campers, but decided to wait and endure the food in London as best as possible after we arrived.

After the wait, we marched dutifully through the Spanish security line and to the gate, where we sat down and waited.  Then the flight got delayed.  And so, we waited, and waited, for at least an hour.  Finally, a nice lady with a limited English vocabulary, came out to (a) inform us that the flight was cancelled for undisclosable reasons, (b) indicate that there would not be another flight for several days, and (c) let us know, kindly, that if we wanted to take the issue up with the airline company, we could go visit the "city-state" (whatever that is).

Then, we got taken on a tour of bowels of the Madrid airport to collect our luggage and get dumped back into the terminal.  At this point, Jake and I had no idea what to do.  Here we had two useless boarding passes for a plane that wasn't going to fly and no known way to get out of Madrid.  So, we went to the line (or rather, clump of people) waiting at the airline ticket office.  Other people who had been completely screwed by the airline had to get their say in, and the line was getting longer.

While waiting, we had formulated a contingency plan.  Plans are the best way to deal with crises, and we both knew it.  It went as follows:  We'd get our money back from these doofy bastards, find a more reliable airline, and catch another flight to London that evening.  We'd probably have to shell a few bucks out, but it'd be worth it.

So, when Jake came back from his turn at the counter (after waiting for 30 minutes to an hour in that line) and told me that the airline didn't have any flights until, like, Saturday, and that they wouldn't refund a dime of money, we were less than thrilled.

Finding another flight out of the airport for any price turned out to be a major issue, as well.  The main carrier in Madrid is Iberia Airlines, and if you read the news, you'll know that they chose that particular Monday to go on strike, grounding upwards of 250 of their flights from Madrid.  We heard the news, too.  Since Iberia was on strike, all of the flights on other carriers were filling up--fast.

Regardless, we waited at the Iberia Airlines desk to see if we could shell out extra money and just catch one of their flights.  Nope; the sole strikebreaker woman behind the desk informed us that there were no fights -- tough luck.  So, we tried EasyJet.  One seat on one airplane -- not for that night, but the next day.  Otherwise, nothing until Thursday.  France Air -- their desk was closing; no more service that night.

We were getting in trouble and fast.  Nobody in the airport seemed to have any flights for that entire week!  So, after some initial panic, a little discussion, and some deep breaths, Jake and I did the only thing we knew; he went back to stand in line at our original airlines and get a hotel voucher so we could try sorting the whole thing out the next day.  It was becoming clear that we weren't getting out of the airport Monday.

We didn't give up, though.  By this time, our primary goal was to leave that rat-pit airport and get in some other country -- <em>any</em> other country!  Well -- minus Morroco, but that's a different story.  So, I headed off to other terminals while Jake pulled line duty.  By this time, the line for our airline had stretched all the way across the terminal.  Jake's instructions to me were clear: "Get any flight out of here tonight at any cost.  Just get us out of here!"  This was around 8 p.m.

The Madrid Airport is huge.  Walking from Terminal One to Terminal Two at a fast clip takes about 15 minutes.  Terminal Three is even futher, and Terminal Four actually requires you to board a bus, get on the freeway, and drive for 10 minutes (no joke!)  I visited them all that night, mostly by foot, only to be turned down by any English-speaking airline desk that wasn't already closed up for the night.

After an hour and a half of my failed quest, I returned to Jake in line to find that <em>he hadn't moved in all that time!</em>  It was horrible.  Nevertheless, we continued to work on our desperate quest of departure.  Since it was evident that we weren't getting out of Madrid that night, we were going to miss our other flight back to the States the next morning.  I had to call Delta and see what our options were; which I did while Jake continued to wait.

I had to get a phone card to call Delta.  The phone-card machine ate my 20 Euro note, which didn't make matters any better.  After spending 40 Euros, I finally got in touch with Delta.  I used all 20 Euros on a thirty-minute phone conversation with the lady from Delta and the automated answering service.  She said no, there were not any seats on any flights from Britain to the States until the 24th of July.  It would be approximately $1000 apiece to change our ticket.  Yes, she could reroute our trip directly from Madrid, but it would be several days before there were seats on those flights, and it would cost $2000 apiece.  Sensing my frustration, the lady from Delta actually told me to check out the competition on the Internet for better prices.

Getting on the Internet wasn't easy there, either.  There were kiosks, but they took only coins, and the ATM only provided large bills.  So, anytime I needed coins, I had to go buy a bottle of water at the cafe for change, which was also a 10-minute round-trip.  Not that it mattered; Jake wasn't going anywhere in that line.

It hurt to keep coming back with worse and worse news.  I told him what Delta said, and that even if we could make it to Britain soon, we wouldn't be making it to the States.  We had been blocked at every turn, and we had two cards left: Get something out of our original airline, or find a flight online.  Either way, it seemed we weren't going anywhere anytime soon, and when we did get out, we'd be broke.

It was around midnight, after four hours in the line, when Jake reached the front of the desk.  We had suffered in the airport for over 12 hours already, walked miles, spent over 100 euros at the airport, hadn't eaten or slept in a day, and waited in the longest, slowest lines I'd ever seen, just to be told "no" for all our efforts.  This is not what I call a vacation.

Divine powers, I suppose, had decided that we had paid for our sins enough that day.  When Jake reached the desk for the second time, the Airline changed its story.  Okay, so they wouldn't refund us our measly $80 for the tickets, but they would put us up in a hotel for the night (what was left of the night), and provide us a way to London the very next day through another airline.  Jake got the vouchers.

Twice is the charm.  When Jake called Delta for a second time at midnight, they somehow found us a spot on the flight a day later than our original flight.  For a $400 change fee, we could be on that next flight.  Done.  The hotel in London we were supposed to be enjoying at this moment, when called, would not refund us our money, though, for our reservation.  So, there was some more dough we were out.

Alas, I didn't care.  I just wanted a bed, shower, and something edible from Texas.  The hotel provided us, along with a collection of other stranded travellers, some food and wine.  We made a toast to leaving Spain/getting home.  Then we slept for five hours before returning to the airport.

The next morning, we were back by nine.  Our vouchers were for Air France, and they looked like they were written on the back of a newspaper clipping.  We got in line at Air France, and the first thing anybody said to us was that our tickets weren't actual tickets, they were just waiting list vouchers on flights that were full.  Here we a go again...

Our tickets routed us through France, and then on to London Heathrow (which was the right country, but wrong airport -- we neeed Gatwick).  We stayed in line despite what we had been told, and the gentleman behind the counter told us that our ticket to France would actually be no problem, but that we hadn't actually been booked at all from France to London.  We'd have to take it up with our original airline, who issued us the voucher, and we'd better do it quickly, seeing as our Madrid-Paris connection was to leave in approximately an hour.

So, Jake and I ran--no, not walked--ran back across the terminal to our original airline.  The lady behind the counter at first didn't want to do anything for us, I remember.  But, we were pros--veterans--by this time.  We knew what we were doing.  Five minutes later, Jake was working out a different ticket arrangement with her.  I, meanwhile was running back the other way across the terminal to pull line duty at Air France.  40 minutes to go until departure.

We made it out of Spain around 10:30 that morning.

But, we had a nine-hour layover in Paris.  So, naturally, since we hadn't slept much or eaten much in two days, we decided to go site-seeing in Paris.  We breezed through Notre Dame, paused for three seconds under the Eiffel Tower, and walked around the Arch of Triumph.  Then we scarfed down McDonalds downtown, and were back at the airport with plenty of time to catch our next flight.  We walked about six miles to do all of that.

After flying into London Heathrow, we had to find a way to London-Gatwick, which was an hour away.  Long story made short, we paid 40 Euros for bus tickets and then attempted to sleep on our luggage all morning in London-Gatwick.  Getting on the Delta flight turned out to be easier, and we flew home to the States.

A couple of lessons learned:

1.  When travelling Internationally, always book direct flights.
2.  Yelling at the airlines works, but the second time around is the charm.
3.  Never, ever fly <strong>Aerolineas Argentinas</strong>
