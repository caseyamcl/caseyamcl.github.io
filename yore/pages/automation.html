I am a little concerned about my car.

Today, I got in, and half of the driver's side of the car was flooded, plus it smelled like somebody had been making poached salmon in the backseat, and the speedometer had become possessed and started going crazy (apparently I was going 80 mph in the parking garage tonight, defying all laws of mechanical physics and probability).  I got to thinking, "In a few months, my financial situation won't look so bad," and then I got to thinking, "poached salmon .. poached salmon.. that sounds pretty good for dinner."  Then I refocused, and something seemed to correlate between good financial status and smelly, leaky car.

Smelly, leaky car ... better financial situation...
smelly, leaky car ... better financial situation...
Smelly, leaky--Eureka!

Thus, after some careful contemplation, I made the executive decision, that if things look good by April, I am going to purchase an automobile.

This will be hard, being that the Saturn and I will have been together for roughly six years... that's <i>six</i> years: two engines, two exhaust systems, three sets of tires (which I have managed to throw out of alignment numerous times), two clutches, two shifting cables, two master clutch cylinders, several spark plugs, a few hundred oil changes, one set of dashboard dice, and a scarf to keep the dashboard from banging against the windshield.

The car and I have a lot of memories during this time: The time that "those kids" dented the top of the car in Orlando; the time I got in and the shifter broke off in my hand; the time that the engine died in Richmond, Virginia.  It's been a great six years.

The latest indication that I should consider a successor to the Saturn came when the window handle broke off in my hand the other day.  The epiphany hit right then, and it was a sad mooment for the Saturn and I.  Regardless, given the resources and several more months, I'll be driving around in a new...

A new... hmm.. well, that poses another issue.  What car should I get?  I really like Audis, and they make great used cars, but I don't own a large bank, so they are kind of on the backburner set of options, given the cost of those Eurocars.

As an alternative, I could drive a:

<center><strong>Volkswagen</strong></center>
<a title="1971 VW Bus" class="imagelink" href="/yore/images/1971_vw_bus-758412.jpg">
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="1971 VW Bus" id="image159" src="/yore/images/1971_vw_bus-758412.jpg" /></div>
</a>

Yes, a Vokswagen, which is great, because (a) it was originally invented by the Nazi's, and (b) it's known as the (extremely metrosexual) cousin to the Audi.  The only problem is that I have a small sense of not wanting to give the indication that I am the kind of guy who ... well... drives a Volkswagen.  I think "Jetta", and I picture some fashion-design girl cruising down the road at roughly three times the marked speed limit, drinking a Starbucks Latte, talking on her cell phone, casually giving the finger to everybody to everybody she cuts off within 50 yards, while listening to Vanessa Carlton.  The <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/jettadrivers/index.html">experts</a> agree with this general view.

...or I could drive a...

<center><strong>Hummer</strong></center>
<a title="Giant Tank" class="imagelink" href="/yore/images/jagdpanther_5-722466.jpg">
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Giant Tank" id="image160" src="/yore/images/jagdpanther_5-722466.jpg" /></div>
</a>

Or, as is the case with these goliath vehicles these days, "Hummer 2", which is even bigger than the original compensation-mobile and twice as ugly to boot (that's where the "2" comes from).  The only problem is that I do not own equity in a small country so therefore cannot afford to purchase one of these "automobiles" (plus Hummers, I hear, get the average gas mileage of an assault tank -- see picture).  Also, I would like to have a car that actually <i>fits</i> in parking spaces.  I think Hummers are more appropriate for ..say.. urban terrorists than a person like me.

...or, maybe a...

<center><strong>Honda</strong></center>
<a title="Honda" class="imagelink" href="/yore/images/honda.jpg">
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Honda" id="image161" src="/yore/images/honda.jpg" /></div>
</a>

Can we portray the image of "white boy pimpin" any more than owning a Honda?  After three microseconds of serious deliberation on the subject of owning a Honda, I decided that I would rather own the aforementioned assault tank (not in the metaphorical sense - I would <i>really</i> rather have an assault tank).  I could, indeed, get the Honda and then of course, add the obligatory layer of black paint, stickers advertising various car audio gear from the 90's, giant oversized muffler (because every girl I've ever come in contact with just loves those things...), and giant speakers that only play musical pieces by Sisqo (somebody pry my eardrums out with needle-nose pliers, please).

So, it appears that the verdict is still out on the car, which is fine, since I have several months to think about this.  Maybe you can help me out.  My qualifications for an appropriate vehicle are:
<ul>
	<li>Does not smell like Salmon</li>
</ul>
So there you have it; let me know what your recommendation is, and I'll keep you posted on my quest for automotive improvement.
