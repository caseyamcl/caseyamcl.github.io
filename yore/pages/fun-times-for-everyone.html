Title: Aggregation in Nonparametric Regression Models

Abstract:  The standard aggregation problem in regression models is the following:  Given <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>,.....,<i>f</i><sub>M</sub> estimators of the unknown regression parameter <i>f</i>, find a way of combining them into a final estimator, the aggregate <i>f</i>.  Typical procedures of aggregation are:  model selection, convex aggregation, and linear aggregation.  The performance of an aggregated estimator given by a particular procedure can be assessed via minimax bounds on its <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> risk E||<i>f</i> - <i>f</i>||<sup>2</sup>.  Nemirovski (2000) suggests that any of the following bounds can be used for such an assessment:
<i>Linear aggregation bounds:</i>  Find the aggregate <i>f</i> whose risk is at least as good as the one of the best linear combination of <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>,.....,<i>f</i><sub>M</sub>, up to a small remainder term.
<i>Convex aggregation bounds:</i>  Find the aggregate <i>f</i> whose risk is at least as good as the one of the best convex combination of <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>,.....,<i>f</i><sub>M</sub>, up to a small remainder term.
<i>Model Selection (MS) bounds:</i>  Find the aggregate <i>f</i> whose risk is at least as Good as the best of <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>,.....,<i>f</i><sub>M</sub>, up to a small remainder term.
Tysbakov (2003) established the order of magnitude of the remainder term, for each bound, and showed that the bounds are achievable, in the minimax sense.  It turns out that the bounds are not comparable with each other universally, some being superior to others in given circumstances.  In this talk we present a procedure that achieves simultaneously <i>all three optimal bounds</i>, and consequently the smallest of them.  Our approach is penalized least squares.  The choice of the penalty term is crucial in achieving all three optimal targets.  We then generalize our method to <i>curve aggression</i>  Given <i>M</i> observed curves,all assumed to follow a stationary time series, we show that the problem of estimating the spectrum of the time series can be recasted as an aggregation problem in nonparametric regression models.  We discuss computational issues that arise in this context and present a comparative simulation study.

Woo hoo!  Refreshments!  I don't know about you, but this thing sounds like a barrel of good times for everybody!  I'll be there.
