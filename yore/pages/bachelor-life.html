The other day, I was invited to the movies by my friend and his girlfriend and her friend and his girlfriend.  So, it was guy/girl, guy/girl, and Casey.  What an opportunity!  The possibilities inherent in being a fifth wheel are often overlooked by those who are put in such a position due to their own self-apathy.  But really, there is more fun in being the free agent on a date than one might suspect.  We were going to see "The Terminal", which was a great movie and occupied my attention almost entirely, but I still had time to think of some fun things to do given my opportunistic position.  Here are some of the fun things the odd-man-out member of the group can do at the movies:

1.  Sit in between the couple you choose to wish to annoy the most and inform them that you will be in charge of this excursion and that will be no hand-holding, eye contact, boy-girl communication, or any of that "lovey-dubby" crap.  You can mediate any conversation between the two of them that happens to crop up if you wish.

2.  Popcorn.  It's a great distraction for the odd-man-out.  You can throw kernels at people, especially the people you are with.  When you can't eat anymore, you can simply dump the entire remainder of the bucket on the female's head and inform her significant other that no decent boyfriend would ever allow somebody do something that audacious to <i>his</i> girlfriend.  Tell the girl that <i>you</i> would never allow that to happen to <i>your</i> girlfriend.

3.  If you really wish to be annoying, I've found that saying extremely cheesy things as reactions to events that happen in the movie can multiply the awkwardness of the whole experience for everybody.  For instance, the character falls down in a humorous fashion, and you say (loudly, of course), "UH-OH!  This can't be good!"; or, the character says something self-incriminating, and you say, "WHOA!  Did you hear what he said?  Did ya hear that??"  The more impossible to ignore you are, the less Romeo and Juliet who you're with can concentrate on each other.

There are, of course, countless opportunities to reek havoc on somebody's date in a retaliatory fashion.  These are just a few examples that I, of course, would never in a million years even <i>think</i> of doing to my friends.

In that regard, I won't even mention my surprise-water cannon idea.
