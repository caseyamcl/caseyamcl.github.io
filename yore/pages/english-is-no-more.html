I deal with computers.  Every day.  And they aren't always friendly.

Sometimes, innocently enough, I'll tiptoe over to a computer, delicately allow my fingers to touch the keyboard, and then, out of nowhere:

<center><b>WARNING! WARNING! FATAL ERROR 0X0000 MEMORY ALLOCATION DUMP AT 0x383489 9x32309434 0x577273 WHAT IS WRONG?! OH MY GOD MY RAM!!! I'M MELTING! I'M MELTING! WHAT A WORLD; WHAT A WORLD..</b></center>

It's kind of a melodramatic computer.  Usually, however, I can deal with it.  I've been around the block with these things; once you beat it into submission with a giant hammer, it usually cooperates.  It's when I start to dwelve into unexplored realms that things get hairy.  For instance, I am trying to do a simple search and replace in pHp, so I look it up, and get this:
<blockquote>When working with a replacement pattern where a backreference is immediately followed by another number (i.e.: placing a literal number immediately after a matched pattern), you cannot use the familiar \\1  notation for your backreference. \\11, for example, would confuse preg_replace() since it does not know whether you want the \\1 backreference followed by a literal 1, or the \\11 backreference followed by nothing. In this case the solution is to use \${1}1. This creates an isolated $1 backreference, leaving the 1  as a literal.</blockquote>
What the heck is this thing saying, and is "\\1 notation" supposed to be familiar to me, and why does my computer get confused?  What next; is it going to get a headache?  Who builds these things, anyhow?  If this is UNIX notation, no wonder Microsoft has a monopoly.  I am pretty sure that assembling an atom bomb is simpler than this.

Sheesh... now to get back to coding pHp in order to phase out my Javascript target_equals code so that I do not have to rely upon multiple language functions in order to perform a single algorithmic SQL query on the "comments" field, which seems to be the only set of methods that I can manipulate given the constraints of time and the mySQL server.

yeah..
