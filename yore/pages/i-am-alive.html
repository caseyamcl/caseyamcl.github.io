In case you were wondering by any chance. I have been living in a cubicle somwhere. I don't really remember where I am, geographically speaking, but I guess it really doesn't matter, since I technically never leave or eat or sleep. I replinish my resources by sucking RF into my brain from my cell phone and absorbing light rays from my computer monitor.

Okay, it's not that bad. I am kind of doing a lot of various stuff, though. In addition to hiring and training at the law firm, I also took a full-time position at the School of Information Studies as the User Services Supervisor for at least six weeks, maybe forever. We'll have to see. I've been living there since I took the position on Monday. My friends say I work too much; my colleagues warn me not to let them overwork me; my professional contacts warn me about nervous breakdown. Meh.

I do however, have a backup plan: Change name, move to Mexico.
