Come Thursday, I will be going to the airport.  At the airport, I will board a plane.  The plane will be heading to Memphis, Tennessee.  Then I will go to another airport.  Then I will get on another plane.  That plane will be going to Chicago.

Yep!  It's time for the annual Chicago pilgrimage of my sister and I.  The first year was "Chicago I: Let's be Tourists".  Then, it was "Chicago II: Let's Try Not to Act Like Tourists".  Then, last year, it was "Chicago III: Time to Party and do Crazy Stuff".  This year it's:
<h1>CHICAGO IV: We Have No Definitive Plans This Year</h1>
Actually, that's not true.  We're going to a Cubs game this year!  (a.k.a. excuse to drink beer and scream a lot)  Then, of course, we're going to that comedy club, among other things.  The question is, as always, of course:  WILL LISA BUY THE FERRIS WHEEL?  Behold:
<div style="text-align: center"><img id="image108" alt="Ferris Wheel" src="/yore/images/06-15-2004-ferriswheel.jpg" /></div>
EVERY YEAR we go to this booth at Navy Pier, and EVERY YEAR she ogles over this thing for 20 minutes and finally decides that she does not want to buy it.  I would have gotten it <em>for</em> her by now, but I am innately curious to see whether or not she will actually ever go through with it and buy the Ferris Wheel.  Buy it, Lisa!  Buy the stupid Ferris Wheel!  You must purchase it!!

It's a completely useless contraption, but it is rather amusing.  The point is, however, that she has completely avoided purchasing it for the past three years.  Perhaps the fourth time is the charm.

Okay, enough digressing on that.  The other BIG INTERESTING COOL THING to do this year is to find this alley that's supposedly haunted.  Yeah, as common sensical as we are, we're going to go seek out this this alley at night and then walk around it.  Perhaps I should buy some life insurance now.

In any case, it should prove to be fun.  We're becoming pretty seasoned at this Chicago thing.  The things we have learned include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Never, ever, ever, ever, everevereverever order Leonardo's Italian Delight food at 2:00 a.m.  That stuff is the antithesis of quality dining.</li>
	<li>It is not necessary to wear $9,000.00 worth of clothes to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</li>
	<li>Casey's martini limit is somewhat less than previously assumed.</li>
	<li>It doesn't matter where you are, but who you're with.  Lisa and I always make our own entertainment in the Windy City.  It'll be good times, as always.</li>
</ul>
Vacation or bust!
