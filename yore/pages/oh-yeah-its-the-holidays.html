Somebody said, "Merry Christmas" the other day, and I thought, "huh?  What the heck is she talking about?  It's not Christmas.  It hasn't even been Thanksgiving ye--Oh wait.  Dang."

"Dang" is right.  What happened?  One minute I'm complaining about having to work during Independence Day, and now, what seems like two days later, I'm complaining about having to work during Christmas break!  I didn't even get a chance to complain (that much) about working on Halloween!  I used to be able to gauge when "that time of the year" was coming by keeping alert about store decorations in retail shops.  The only problem is that this year, they decided to put up their Christmas decorations in the mall right after the Easter Bunny left.  It's Capitalism gone bad!

What really drove the point home that this is the time of year that everybody gets to start stressing about buying stuff and acting happy, etc. is Helen saying, "Guess what I got you for Christmas?!!"  Whenever anybody's "significant other" says something like that, the party on the receiving end goes numb.  Their blood runs cold and it feels like their feet have been chopped off and thrown into a bucket of ice.  Yes, it's time for significant-other shopping.  The gift has to be just right, but it can't be too expensive or too cheap, and it has to be meaningful, and it has to be a surprise, and it has to... you get the picture.  I, of course, have everything under control.  I'm ss-ssuave and pr-prepared, and I kn-kn-kn-kn-know exacty whhhhaaat I'm going to do for He-Hel-Helennn for Christmas.  (whew).

See?  I'm not nervous at all.

The issue here really is that guys like me are afraid of the mall.  We occasionally drive into the parking lot, take a few trips around and <i>think</i> about parking, but never really work up the momentum to do it.  Then we leave and "swear" that we'll do it tomorrow.   Sometimes I make it inside the mall, but for fear of being trampled by a mob of sixteen-year old girls with large bags too busy talking on their cell phones to each other to notice me walking (I could be killed) I'll duck inside a store and hope that maybe, that perfect gift, which is not too expensive, not too cheap, meaningful, surprising, etc. is sitting on a display rack in there just waiting for me to grab it so I can go careening out of the mall and back to my car and drive somwhere safer, like a third-world country.  Unfortunately, it ususally turns out to be a model train shop or a hiking boots store.  "Does Helen like hiking boots?"  I think.  "No," my brain says.  Shoot.

Of course, I have been picking on Helen a lot in this blog.  In actuality, buying things for other people, no matter who those people are, can be a nerve-racking experience.  I have bought people some very, very stupid things in the past for certain holidays--so stupid in fact, that I will not mention them in this post but suffice it to say that if you, my friend, are shopping for somebody for Christmas, do not even consider anything with the words "Astrology Calendar" in it.

In any case, now that I've realized that it has come, much like the Four Horsemen of the Apolcolypse, I must get busy driving in circles around the mall.
