Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and anybody who happens to fall into categories other than the ones aforementioned, I proposition to boldly state that, in the due course of my vast 21 years of expierence in being a human being, I have observed the decline of our society morally, socially, intellectually, physically, unrealistically, barbitoulsy, and photosynthesistically (the last of these assertations not actually being a real word).

Why is such a phenomenon happening in a society as advanced as ours? Good question. We have our television, Internet, five-lane highways, ultra-powered telescopes, microwave ovens, dyanamic lasers, retina-scanners, high fidelity projectors, automatic tansmissions, expresso machines, etc. etc. blah blah yadda yadda moo. The question is fundamentally insoluable; however, there are many different theses that can be explored including the dumbing-down of higher education, the foot-ball/pickup truck/cell phone culture that society propounds as the "American Dream", greed, lust, green cows from Neptune, giant mosquitos, etc. etc... you get the idea.
Do intend to ansewr these questions in this post? I would definitely say "No," and I say this for two reasons. The first is that people have been throwing around arguments to deal with this situation for years, and have been mostly going around in circles when they could be doing something more productive for society, like watching paint dry. The second is a little more personal, and it involves the fact that I think my supervisor is coming, and I have to pretend like I'm working.

Thus, this post is officially ended.  Have a nice day.
