title: 'Two Minutes of Politics'

I don't usually go into politics on this site, because (a) I generally don't like politics, even though I think we have a civic duty to be involved, and (b) everybody else on the Internet has already spoken enough on political subjects to make enough reading material for the next millennium.

So, it is with a bit of departure from the usual informative weblog posts that deal with important subjects, such as lunch, that I write my thoughts on the recent hurricane disaster.

In that regard, I'll keep it short: It is not time to criticize people.  Recently, a storm hit the gulf coast, but that was nothing compared to the storm the media created upon realizing it had some new material to manipulate for the next several months.  And so it has become that every political subgroup here in the nation has used this disaster as ammunition to blast whomever they dislike the most.
