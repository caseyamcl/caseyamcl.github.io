We're now six days into the new year, and I have decided to make good on at least one of the many resolutions that I boldly put forth seven days ago, and that is actually producing <span style="text-decoration: line-through">meaningful</span> content.

In the spirit of such resolution, I provide you with a brief recount of the latter portion of my December:

It has been several days since my brother and I took our American Civil War trip in the name of educating ourselves, at respective levels of knowledge, about history.  This is a task that I have, in the past, always pursued while sitting in a desk waiting for a bell to ring signaling the dismissal of some class.  The general goal of my prior pursuits in history were based upon the ideology that the less knowledge procured in the process, the better.  That way, I could leave valuable brain cells available for things like: (1) dumb jokes I found on the Internet, and (2) all the cheat-codes to video games.

The Civil War trip we took a few weeks ago was quite different, however.  Instead of sitting somewhere reading from a book about the Civil War, we were out in the field, walking around, reading from various signs scattered all over a mile-long patch of grass.  The signs generally said things to the effect of, "It was here that General Lee, in a  tactical effort to avoid being flanked by the Union lines, moved his army around to the left, but then turned right, and then turned left again ... blah blah blah...".  The signs usually also included a depiction of General Lee doing whatever it was that the sign said he was supposed to have done.

Overall, however, by standing at the spot where major historical events took place, one gets a general feel for how the battles played out.  For instance, I had to wonder how General Pickett's men maneuvered around the observation tower, across the four-lane highway (avoiding the Mack trucks), through the McDonald's parking lot, and across suburbanites' backyards without being slowed down by all the obstacles.  Sadly, the history books fail to recount these details.

In order to gain the full Civil War experience, we decided to live as the soldiers did, surviving off small scraps of food, containing only the merest traces of nutrition (McDonald's), traveling many miles each day (I-95), and alleviating boredom by whatever means necessary during the haul (reading Civil War signs and watching South Park).  It was quite a trip.

Speaking of resolutions, one of my other New Year's resolutions was to become more productive at work, which I have completely failed at in the past 20 minutes, since I am sitting here writing this instead of doing useful things for the people that pay me.  Therefore, I write no more for now!
