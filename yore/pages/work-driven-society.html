I always open up the Blogger window with something in mind interesting to say.. I always have that certain thought that I just have to share with the world, and then, while waiting for the page to load, something shiny catches my eye, and alas, the moment has past.

I've gotten that a lot lately, and like any true capitalistic American, I blame work, which has slowly been sucking my soul out for the past few weeks.  Actually, a lot of people criticize me for working too much, which is understandable considering the fact that I can spend upwards of 70 hours a week working on <i>something</i>, but I usually don't complain when its on a personal level.

No, I save the complaints for the macro level of worktitude in our society.  Consider the fact that Americans work more on average than any other industrialized country in the world, and we take fewer vacations as well.  9 to 5 is a thing of the past.  Truely ambitious individuals are not expected to have a life outside of the office, and we sanctify those who spend their lives devoted to their jobs.  It's independence.

I go to work before 8 every morning and often don't emerge until after 7 at night.  Many times, it's a personal decision to stick around.  After all, work is school, and school is work for me, and both constitute life.  Other times, seven o'clock rolls around and I am left wondering what happened to eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve, one, two, three, four, five, and six.  Did somebody press the fast-forward button on life?

In today's executive-driven world, we have meetings after meetings, and a few ad hoc meetings, which in turn lead to more meetings, where decisions are made to hold more meetings, which lead to votes to form committees which will meet regularly to discuss the results of sub-committee meetings, and by the time we are done meeting, we have no idea what it was we met about in the first place.  It could have been about the implementation of blade servers or about cheese.  Who knows?

I often wonder if this work-centric mentality is necessarily healthy.  I mean, we here in the U.S.A. are the top grossers in the world in terms of work product.  But, where will that necessarily get us?  For all the information we produce, disseminate, develop, plan, etc. it seems the average American's goal in life is to go home and watch television.

And where are we going with this information?  Certainly not into space, since that initiative has been severely cut.  Is our capitalistic society value driven?  Is it truly productive as a race?  Are we just roaming the surface of the planet exchanging paperwork and selling each other hamburgers for the heck of it?

I found a note fastened to the windshield wiper on my car this evening when I left the office.  It said, "poop".

I guess that about sums up the human perspective on the working world.
