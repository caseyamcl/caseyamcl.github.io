..is exactly what this website needs, so I will attempt to find some and put it here.  Pardon this big, corporate-sounding word.  My boss just rolled back into town today and came barging in my office around 8:30 this morning, so I thought I'd get back in <a href="http://devca.net/blog-new/#">lingo mode</a>.  Of course, I don't know how long this will be happening; he has made the decision that he never wants to come back to Tallahassee ever again, because every where else in the world is better.  One day, I expect him to take off to some place in Europe and never see him again.  The staff here may not ever know the difference.

These past few weeks have been rough, but things are getting better.  On Saturday, my friend Keri and I met up with some guy from South America and went running.  Her and I got about 3 hours of sleep the night before collectively between the two of us, so we made it about three miles and then fell over.  That aside, it was fun.  The South American guy was cool; he enlightened me to the fact that some marathon runners in Columbia eat only beans and rice as the staple of their diets.  I speak quite honestly when I say, God Bless America.

My new place is pretty nice.  On the outside, it looks like a run-down motel, but it's great on the inside.  I've been moving in for the past two weeks now in 15-minute spurts, and one major Blitzkreig (thanks to the help of <a href="http://wovenandspun.blogspot.com">Anna</a>), and I've still got a ton of stuff to bring over.  I <em>thought</em> I was a minimalist.  Apparently not.  Living alone does have its perks.  For instance, I ate only microwave popcorn for two days straight, and nobody was around to say, "Isn't that a bad idea?"  Also, I can walk everywhere now, which is excellent, since even for staff members, finding parking at FSU is like finding the end of Pi.

That's about it for now, since I am wasting valuable company time updating this website, I think I shall get back to staring at the ceiling and making it look like I actually do work.
