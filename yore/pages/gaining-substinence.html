Bratwurst.

What is it?

Where did it come from?

What do you do with it?

These questions, and many others continue to confound members of the highly elite fast-food industry.  This post attempts not to answer these inconceivable questions, but to delve into the controversy and mystery surrounding this gastronomy.  Consider the account of one hungry man's search for Bratwurst on a Monday afternoon at an on-campus food service location:

Hungry Guy:  I've had exactly six jaw-breakers, one Snicker's Bar, and about five potato chips in the past 18 hours.  I should get some food before I keel over and die.

--Saunters up to a fast-food place entitled "Java City"--

--Menu Reads:  (in large red print) "Bratwurst: $2.50; Hotdog $1.50; Hamburger: $3.00; Coffee: $0.50"--

Food-Service Professional: May I help you?

Hungry Guy:  Yes, I will have a Bratwurst.

Food-Service Professional:  ... [silent stare; mouth hangs open dull-wittedly] ...

Hungry Guy:  Excuse me?

Food-Service Professional:  ... duh ...

Hungry Guy:  Yeah, I'll have .. well I'll have the Bratwurst.

Food-Service Professional:  The what?

Hungry Guy:  The Bratwurst.  It's on your menu.  See?

--Hungry guy gestures towards menu--

Food Service Professional:  ... [silent stare; mouth hangs open dull-wittedly] ...

Hungry Guy:  Do you have any Bratwurst?

Food Service Professional:  What is that?

Hungry Guy:  It's on your menu?  See, I just pointed at it.

Food Service Professional:  I dunno.  (Turns around and yells)   Hey, ya'll got any Brut-worst thing back there?

Unknown Person in Backroom:  The what?

Food Service Professional:  I dunno.  Brut-wast, Brat-Worst, Bru-Moist.. Some guy's askin for Bra-Waist.

Unknown Person in Backroom:  We don't got no breakfast.  It's 1 o'clock.

-- Food Service Professional Disappears --

-- Two Minutes Later --

Food Service Professional:  We don't got none.

Hungry Guy:  Okay, how about just a hotdog then?

Food Service Professional:  ... [silent stare; mouth hangs open dull-wittedly] ...

Thus far, our improvised researcher is still without any nutrition, and the mystery of what exactly a bratwurst is still remains inexplicably unsolved.
