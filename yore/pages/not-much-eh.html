Not much has been happening on this site as of late, which is due to an anomaly in the alignment of the planets that has caused my aurora to shift 10 centimeters to the left forcing a polarity discontinuity in the overall pseudo-gravitational field surrounding my person.Â  This is has all resulted, in one way or another, in my being extremely busy and overwhelmed (yet again) as of late with massive amounts of work.

I just thought I'd share that with you.
