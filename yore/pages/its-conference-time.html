The brisk, cool, 90-degree Fahrenheit winds of October are upon us.  You know what that means, don't you?  Of course you don't, you numskull.  It <em>means</em> that it is Conference Time again.  This will be my second big, corporate conference since I became a corporate drone.  I get to drive or fly somewhere, stay in a hotel, and sit around and listen to old guys talk about stuff they can sell me.

Actually, it may be a bit different from <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/2005_04_01_weblog_archive.php#111243174972364436">last time</a>.  It's the Educause Conference in Orlando, and apparently, it's pretty big.  For the past four weeks, all kinds of I.T. companies have been sending me flyers inviting me to special events at the conference.  These events are, of course, held after hours, which at first made me think, "hmmm.. I'm in Orlando.. one block away from Pointe Orlando.. with a stipend.. do I <em>really</em> want to sit around all night with a bunch of Information Technology dudes sipping martinis and talking about microprocessors?  I submit that I do not!"

Upon closer examination, however, I have come to the conclusion that I was initially wrong.  All of these event invitations reflect a single theme:  the people at this Educause Conference simply want to party.  Consider where one of the special after-hours event invitations I received is located: <a href="http://www.metropolismatrix.com/matrix/">at this place</a>.  Not exactly your daddy's kind of conference, methinks.

The conference people also say that they're having a giant Mardi Gras party in the streets outside one night, which is odd, since I thought Mardi Gras is in February.  But, hey... whatever; it's an excuse to fiesta and these Educause people seem to be all for the par-tay.

I feel confident, coming from the former #1 Party School in the nation, as well as a top-10 ranked alcohol abuse school, that I will have a great task in front of me, representing FSU at the conference.  I'm trying to learn how to stumble around and slur my words better so that I can fit in with the Educause crowd better ("<em>Heyare, baby.. Iewould lurve to opern yur textbook anyteyme..harharhar ::belch::</em>").  I don't think I'm very good at it yet.

I'll keep trying.  A respectable individual must hold himself to extremely high standards when attending professional conferences.
