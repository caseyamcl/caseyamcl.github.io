Hola amigos. Lo siento for the lack of content, but mama mia, it's been a little crazy these days.

I've become a pHp developer at work all of the sudden, writing web applications for things like mySQL database automation, RSS parsing, and all kinds of other server administrator functions that we're letting students get their hands on.  Some dead Linux developer is rolling over in his grave right now considering what we're letting the masses do on our systems.

Other than that, I've been immersing myself in German, and I'm about to start the <a href="http://fsi-language-courses.com/GermanBasic.aspx">Foreign Institute Training Program</a> just for the "fun" of it.  The same kind of fun that Winston Churchill once spoke about.. you know "blood, toil, tears, and sweat."  But, hopefully, I'll come out of this knowing how to say, "Can you please pass me another Bratwurst, please?  I can't eat just 10," or "your toupee looks like it is made of astroturf."  It's an aspiration that I fully intend to live up to.

Also, running... I can now map my routes on <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a>, which is really cool (see image below), which means that I can now accurately say that I ran 6.4 miles on Sunday.  I can also say that it was approximately 70,234,024 degrees outside (a slight guess), and that it must have been uphill both ways (I can't really say how this is, but I am sure of it).  But, hey.. 6.4 miles in Venus-level temperatures.  Go, Google Earth, you motivating piece of.. er .. software, you.

Enough time off; it's time to get back to working for the man.. or, in my case, about 20 men, 30 women, and 1200+ students.  See you on the other side!
