Naively, many of us believe, or have believed in the past, that all printed text exists to be informative in one way or another.  Lately, however, I've come to the realization that barely <i>any</i> written text is actually produced to actually inform.  This thought struck me as I was reading the back of a potato chip bag.

The first noticeable thing on the back of the bag is the "nutrition Facts" section, which is required by lawyers, under penalty of them coming out of their holes in the ground and casting spells on you, to be printed on all packaged consumables sold in the U.S.  One may at first believe that this label is placed on food products to inform consumers about the health content of what's in the package they're buying, but I mean.. come on.  First of all, who buys potato chips for their health value, anyway?  Never have I heard somebody say, "I'm watching what I eat, so I think I'll go pick up a bag of potato chips."  It is for this reason that they can pretty much print whatever they want on the back of these things.  Secondly, the "servings per container" thing can mislead even the occasional eccentric person who dares to read the "Nutrition Label".  Sure, there's only 5 grams of fat <i>per ounce</i>.

The nutrition label on typical bag of potato chips could read something like this:
<blockquote>
<b>NUTRITION FACTS:</b>
Serving Size: 0.00000001 nanograms
Servings Per Container: 3.68 X 10<sup>67</sup>
<hr>
Total Fat: 10g
Saturated Fat: 10g
Trans Fat: 10g
Death Fat: 10g
<hr>
Cholesterol: Too Much
Sodium: 250,000 mg
<hr>
Rat Drool: 15g
Snakes Blood: 10g
Sugars: 0g
Bat's Ear: 6g
Protein: 3g</blockquote>
...and people would still eat it!

That is a <i>slight</i> embellishment, I admit, but I can quote the "Ingredients" section directly:

<b>Ingredients</b>: Potatoes, Corn and/or Cottonseed Oil, Salt.

<i>AND/OR</i> Cottonseed oil??  What exactly does that mean?!  Does it mean that they have this big lever in the factory that says "Corn" on one side and "Cottonseed Oil" on the other, and whenever they feel like it, they simply pull the lever?  I'm rather worried.  I don't even know what Cottonseed oil is!  I thought shirts were made out of cotton, not potato chips.  Frankly, this scares me.  I would like to know if I'm eating corn or if I am eating cottonseed oil, or perhaps if I am eating both.  From the ingredients, it is impossible to tell.

The, of course, there is the front of the bag.  It makes the rather bold statement (printed in bold lettering on the front):

<center><strong>"Guaranteed Fresh Until Printed Date: MAY 25 332107706 0943 38"</strong></center>

I don't know about that.  Did you ever stop to wonder what the "332107706 0943 38" means?  Perhaps it is encoded text that reads, "Just Kidding.. Sucker!  These potato chips were actually made at the height of the Roman Empire!" when decoded.  Personally, I think it is quite a bold statement to make in saying that they "guarantee" that the potato chips will be fresh until May 25.  What if some science students opened a bag and put the contents into a tank of full of warm water highly concentrated with bacteria?

Would the potato chips still be fresh a month later?  Could the students sue the potato chip company for false advertising?  Would they want to drag lawyers out of lawyer-repository tanks to actually pursue the matter?  Would they win and cause some ridiculous message like: "Guaranteed Fresh Until May 25 So Long as the contents of this bag are not placed in environments conducive to excessive wear or degradation whereupon the contents of this bag would be subject to increased rates of devolution from their natural, desirable state (i.e. 'chips' of potato soaked in salt, corn <i>AND/OR</i> Cottonseed Oil).  If such excruciating circumstances are placed upon these 'chips' of potato and a claim is subsequently filed in any judicial institution, we retain the express right to spawn our lawyers out of the ground and have them shoot laser beams from their eyeballs at you." to be printed on the bag?

I do not know the answers to these questions, but I do know that I am hungry.  So, I am going to open my bag of corn-and/or-cottonseed-oil-rats blood-bats ear-"chips of potato" and proceed to consume them, for better or worse.
