My friend told me that I should write 100 things about myself and post it on the Internet, since that seems to be what everybody is doing.

I thought, "Man, I could never sit through that!"  But I decided to try anyhow.

So.... first, I number the blank lines.... <i>[Okay, done]</i>

Then... I fill them in...

1. My name is Casey.
2. I like macaroni and cheese.
3. I ..uhh.. write things online occasionally.
4. I work for a University.
5. Did I mention that I like macaroni and cheese?
6. Oh yes, and my name is Casey, but you knew that already.
7. Hey.. look!  Seinfeld is on!
