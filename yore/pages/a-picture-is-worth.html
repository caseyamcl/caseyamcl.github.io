Since I don't have time to write about what's going on these days, I figured I'd draw a picture using MS Paint to serve as a metaphor for what's going on in my life right now.

I believe this should explain everything clearly:
<div style="text-align: center"><img id="image93" alt="Metaphor" src="/yore/images/04-21-2004-metaphor.jpg" /></div>
