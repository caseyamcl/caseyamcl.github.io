This morning, Hurricane Jeanne ripped across Tallahassee.  Or, more accurately, I should say, Hurricane Jeanne oozed across Tallahassee dropping what meteorologists are calculating to be micrometers of rain and winds up to three miles per hour.

In other words, the Big Bad Storm that CNN will allude to in its efforts to increase its ratings (I love it when objective news sources use such colorful phrases likes "decimates", "plunders", and "rips apart to the point of oblivion" in their personification of weather patterns), did not pack enough force to warrant closing down FSU for a third time this month, much to many students' and staff members' absolute dismay.

For yours truly, this meant that our all-but-famed Deans Search Committee Conference was still on for this afternoon.  The school that I spend most of my conscious life at is currently searching for a new head dean, and they've narrowed the applicant pool down to two candidates.  Today, we heard Candidate Number One speak (we'll just call him "No. 1" for the purposes of our discussion here) about what he thinks <i>he</i> can do for <i>us</i>.

The powers-that-be decided that we needed to have both a live webcast of the event and an online chat session, which meant pulling together a bunch of people from different departments and coordinating the use of a lot of heavy duty equipment, which of course, always works until the exact moment you need it.  Such was the case today.  What was supposed to be a rather seamless and well-planned event, my moment to shine, so to speak, turned out to be a tour de force of almost comical random disasters.

First, we came to find that the sound system in the room was, in a word, nonfunctional.  No worries, we concluded.  However this new dean guy was, if he was going to pilot an entire <i>department</i> (and soon to be college) within the University, he must be able to project his voice in a small room of fifty people.  As it turned out, the guy was as quiet as a mouse.  The people in the front row could barely make out his lecture about how he would fight proactively, boldly, and (ironically) loudly for funding for our department.

The highly technical and complicated webcast fulfilled its purpose in life by not working and making everybody tear their hair out.  The "expert" on webcasting that we had on-site was extremely helpful when he pointed out, "well gawsh, that thar has never happened before.  Not in my 'sperience as a webcasting fella here at this here university".  Gee, thanks.  After much running around and being a general distraction overall, we got it working.  The live chat session, though worked fine, and our distance students, who took our technical failure as a cue to begin whining about FSU's incompetency the entire time until the webcast got up, were very appreciative in saying, "About time, losers!"

Personally speaking, I myself managed to only become the center of attention twice.  The first being when I managed to spill my drink all over the floor right in the middle of No. 1's exciting lecture.  The second was when my mobile phone decided it needed to ring, the volume of which, given our speaker's articulate and projective nature, managed to overpower him exponentially.  It doesn't help that my cell phone ring distinctively resembles that of chicken screeching as a result of say, a severe flesh wound.  I got some pretty evil looks.  Such amicability in our fun little department.

Finally, our distinctive scholar's lack of ability to operate a PowerPoint slide remote control to flip between slides on the projection screen was as perplexing as his inability to project his voice past what my fifth grade teacher used to refer to as "twelve-inch decibles".  Perhaps the single button on the slide remote control was perplexing to him.  That darned confusing technology that we have these days...

Despite all my cynical remarks, however, we came out of the event considering it a relative success.  Everybody seemed to like the guy, even though, realistically speaking, nobody managed to hear a word he said.  However, we <i>think</i> that he said some pretty smart stuff.  Maybe that's how he's made it this far in his career: ambiguity and mystery.  My guess is that he is a pretty reputable individual, just hard to hear.

I've learned something from all of this, though, and that is... hmmm... Shoot, I forgot it.  Maybe the point of this posting got swept away with Jeanne.
