I realize I haven't updated in a while, so I give you a special treat today:

<center><strong>Wooing Senior Managers</strong></center>

To woo a senior manager, first consider complimenting said manager on his or her choice of clothes.  Also, show up early and bring flowers, and sometimes chocolates.  When you get to the restaurant, always seat the senior manager first and compliment him or her again on how amazing said manager's hair looks.  After dinner, you may consider going for a walk in the park or perhaps to a picture show--WAIT A MINUTE, this is all wrong--let's try again:


<center><strong>Wooing Senior Managers</strong></center>

Ahem: Wooing senior managers is all about trying to sell the people who cut your paycheck on something they either don't want to do or don't care about.  In fact, whatever it is you have to say is pretty much a waste of their valuable time, for which they don't get paid to listen to you jab on about spending the organization's precious monetary and time resources on your hairbrained, moronic mental concoctions.  Now go back to your desk, shut up, and work on your TPS report.

OR... you can follow these six easy principles that are sure to keep any senior manager from hurling objects on his desk at you (at least more than twice).  With a bit of fortune, your manager may even, actually <em>listen to what you have to say</em>, so take notes, because this is going to be good:

1.  Keep it short, and to the point:  Two things that senior managers hate to do are read what you write and to listen to you.  Unfortunately, at least part of your presentation involves one or both of these things, so you must keep them minimal at best.  The challenge here lies in the fact that in order to make your point, you must either speak or write it.  It's the whole communications process, and it won't work in your favor unless you do some "out of the box creative thinking".

For instance, you may consider making the written presentation a bit more readable by superimposing a picture of Pamala Anderson in a swimsuit on proposal.  If your senior manager is a woman, you can superimpose that guy from the Brawny paper towel roll commercials.  This tactic has been statistically proven to increase your chances of being approved by an exponential factor.   If you can get Pamala Anderson and/or the Brawny Guy to come out and do your proposal presentation for you, Kudos!  Your proposal, whatever it is (new furntiure, database system changes, new corporate jet, jacuzzi in your office, whatever) will approved without question!

Barring the availability of this method, there are other (lesser) things you can do to keep your presentation on-track and avoid being lengthty.  One very simple tactic is to use bullet statements, not narratives, when trying to communicate effectively with your organization's leaders.  In fact, before finalizing your proposal, you may want to scan it and ensure that there are absolutely <strong><u>NO</u></strong> complete sentences or thoughts anywhere in the document.  E.g. "We estimate that this project will cost approximately $8,500.00 in monetary funds" should be "Project cost many much dollars" (insert a picture of dollar bills here to drive home your point); or: "In order to accomplish this goal, the network data system will have to be shut down for approximately 4 hours," should be: "computer go boom for long time."

Senior managers like this simple, to-the-point way of communicating.


2.  Use language that your senior manager can understand:  Remember, because your senior manager occupies a position above you in the corporate structure of your organization, he or she is going to be much less attuned to details and generally won't understand the particulars of your job the way you understand them.  As such, you must use simple words, and spell things out in B-L-O-C-K L-E-T-T-E-R-S.

How do you know if you've stopped speaking in layman's terms and that your manager doesn't understand you?  That's tough to quantify, but if you see your manager cocking his head to the side during the interview (or scratching his ear with his leg), it means you have either befuddled him or lost his attention.  This is bad, and you need to avoid it.  Here are some general rules-of-thumb, so to speak, that may assist you:
<ul>
	<li>Go home and practice your presentation in front of your dog (or perhaps a household plant) and try to gauge the reaction of your pet to see if he has (a) understood your points, or (b) circled around a few times, sat down, and gone to sleep.  You may expect the reaction of your senior manager to be very similar to whatever your dog does.</li>
	<li>Never use words with more than three syllables, and cut out words where more than three consonants are back-to-back.  These are difficult to say, and therefore difficult to understand.  Your manager has killed those verbal recognition braincells over the years by drinking martinis with other senior managers at hotel bars during literally hundreds of conference trips.</li>
	<li>If you get in a tough spot, you may throw out any of the following useful phrases (they don't mean anything, but generally solicit positive responses from senior managers): "Dynamic Synergy", "Team Performance", "Synergestic Communications", or "Progressive Convergence".  Also, you may mix and match terms from this list as you wish without negative conesquences.</li>
</ul>
3.  Show how you can do more with less:  Remember, resources are scarce, and senior managers don't like to waste them, especially not on you.  So, you have to show your manager that you're not wasting anything more than necessary with your proposal.  You have to prove that you've done your research (see #4), and that you've considered every single possible alternative in the universe, including murdering your aunt and selling her body for scientific research in order to gain funds for your proposal, before you arrived at your current plan.

This is difficult to do, because you are only human, and it is nearly impossible to consider every single possible alternative, so don't even try.  Here's what to do:  Senior managers always have arch rivals; usually they are senior managers themselves, working in other departments.  Your job is to find who your senior manager's arch rival is and then exploit this for the good of your project.  Here's an example:  You're trying to convince the boss to purchase a new videoconferencing device for your department; your boss hates the head of another department, whom we will call "Bob of Department X".  Given this knowledge, you could do one of two things:

(a) Painstakingly research which videoconferencing solution would work best for your department while saving the most money, lasting the longest, and providing the best possible return-on-investment while generally supporting the mission of your organization; or,

(b) Find out which videconferencing solution Bob in Department X uses, and casually bring this up in the proposal meeting with your boss.

<b>You:</b> "...and one other reason that we'd like to purchase the new Cyber-Conference 8000 is because I talked to my counterpart in Department X, and they're using it over there quite successfu-"

<b>Your Boss:</b> "Wait a minute!  Isn't Department X the one that Bob heads?"

<b>You:</b> "Why yes; yes it is."

<b>Your Boss:</b> "Argh!  Ahem-Is there a better model?  This just doesn't seem like it will meet our needs."

<b>You:</b> "Well, in fact, there <em>does happen to be</em> the Cyber-Conference <em>9000</em> which is considerably more impressive than the Cyber-Conference 8000 in every possible way, but I'd figured that since times are tight and-"

<b>Your Boss:</b> "Get the 9000!  It sounds like the better one will help us more with our ...er, um... dynamic convergence."

<b>You:</b> Reach around and pat self on back; job well done.

I realize that it may seem that this in no way shows you how to, in fact, do more with less.  But, if you read carefully, you will see that this method actually illustrates a scenario wherein you can get the job done <em>more</em> succesfully in <em>less</em> time; thus, you, your senior manager, and your entire organization will thank you.


4.  Do your homework:  Senior managers expect you to know what you are doing, and sometimes you have to prove this explicitely.  They're likely to ask questions during your proposal presenation that you haven't thought of, which means that you're not good enough to work for the organization, and that you will be fired immediately.

Just kidding, of course.  You won't be fired until <em>after</em> the presentation.  That is, unless you can answer all of their questions well.  So, you must learn everything you can about what your proposal is, how many resources it will use, what requirements are to implement it, what could possibly go wrong, and how you would deal with it.

Or, you can just trust the Law of Corporate Inverse Intellegence, which we breifly alluded to earlier.  The law can be summarized using a basic equation:

<center><strong> 1 / (Number of Layers in your Organizational Chart - The Number of Layers Underneath Your Senior Manager's Position) = Your Senior Manager's Intellegence Quotia (as it applies to whatever you're proposing)</center></strong>

Simply put, this means that there is a good chance your senior manager will not know what the heck you're talking about.  As such, he or she will most likely spend your entire presentation thinking about what happened on the last episode of <em>24</em>, what restaurants serve the best lobster in town, Pamala Anderson in a swimsuit, or the Brawny Paper Towel Guy.  In other words, don't kill yourself over this rule.  Occasionally, however, the manager might pipe up with a tough question that you may have to quickly find an answer to, as in this situation:

<b>You:</b> "So you see how these new servers, at a mere price of $12,300.00 over four years, will increase our data processing capabilities by a factor of 30."

<b>The Boss:</b> "Yes, but what have you factored our projected company growth over the next four years into that cost analysis?"

<b>You</b> (who obviously haven't done any such thing): "Uhm, err... Well, that isn't necessary because of the -uh- rotator splints that are included in the CPU cores of these new units."

<b>The Boss (suspicously):</b> "I didn't know CPU cores had rotator splints."

<b>You (regaining composure):</b> "Oh, of course.  They are there to keep the RAM valves oiled; plus, they ensure 4 year longevity of company growth up to a specified percentage."

<b>The Boss:</b> "What percentage?"

<b>You:</b> "Thirty-fiiii..What percentage are we projected to grow?"

<b>The Boss:</b> "Forty-five percent over four years."

<b>You:</b> "Definitely fifty percent."

See how you handled this situation?  You used on-the-fly information to come up with a suitable answer to the unexpected interrogation.  In reality, too, you must be able to cope with the unexpected.  So, do your homework.

Or, just make stuff up.


5.  Show that you understand your organization:  This is actually easier than it may sound.  For instance, if most of the employees in your organization speak English, you should rule out the possibility of preparing your proposal in Portugese.  Or, for example, if your organization is Fascist Germany, then it would not be a good idea to propose Jewish Heratige Day as a company morale booster.

A little common sense and understanding can go long a way here.  Most companies don't like to be wasteful, so be sure that you show your understanding of this.  Also, there are always people in the organization that are universally disliked; you don't want to show how your proposal will help them continue to be lazy/abrasive/smelly/alive/etc.

A creative employee will take tidbits of company knowledge, such as these, and put them together to help push his or her proposal.  The clever employee may say, "Our new system will cost $36,000, but we will recover the entirity of that within thee weeks of implementation by placing the new unit next to Merve's office.  The unit will generate enough deadly RF rays to drive Merve off screaming within said time period, thus eliminating his $36,000 salary from the payroll and equalizing the books" (you may expect a round of applause from your heartless senior managers after a display of cunning insight such as this one).

Also, always use the company logo on anything and everything that you present.  It shows that you've thought about your proposal within the context of the organization, even though you really haven't.  To save time, you may wish to just copy and paste random bits of text from your computer to fill in the content of your written proposal.  As long as your company logo is there in full-color, you can count on it distracting your employer enough to not pay attention to that boring black-and-white text with all those pie charts and percent signs and stuff.  I usually just copy and paste the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napolean_Bonaparte">biography for Napolean Bonaparte from Wikipedia</a> to fill the content void for my written proposals.

With all this in mind, we move on to our final bit of advice:

6.  Present Your Proposal with a Sense of Urgency - This is the most improtant of all.  It is common knowledge that 80% of what you say is not communicated verbally, and since your senior manager won't really be listening to you anyway, this figure jumps up to 100% in your case.  So what makes up the rest of that communication figure?  Many things, but most especially HOW you conduct yourself during your proposal.

It is quite difficult to quantify exactly how one should conduct him or herself during a proposal meeting, since every situation solicits its own set of norms and expectations.  An example, though, may help.  Consider the case of Zeke, who works as a space planner for his company.  Zeke wants to remove 5 water fountains in Building "B" to make room for electronic sensor equipment.  So, he begins to work on a written proposal.

Now, how can Zeke attack this issue a sense of urgency?  Well, perhaps he could explain the necessity of new sensor equipment, but the managers probably wouldn't understand any of the technological gobbly-gook.  They'd ask, "Why do we need them now if we haven't had them in the past," for which the answer of, "because they would keep our mechanical equipment from wearing out," or some other boring explanation just wouldn't cut the mustard on the urgency meter.

Instead, Zeke wisely decides that it would be better to attack the problem of removing the water fountains using a subject that his senior managers can understand, and, through careful formatting and choice of words <em>while considering</em> ALL of the other pieces of advice we have discussed, comes up with a Grade-A Proposal of the highest quality possible:

<a title="A Proper Business Proposal" class="imagelink" href="/yore/images/05-23-2006-businessproposal.jpg">
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="A Proper Business Proposal" id="image203" src="/yore/images/05-23-2006-businessproposal.jpg" /></div>
</a>

Now that's a good proposal.  Any senior manager in his right mind would act on this immediately while placing complete faith in the trusty employee

I know I sure would.  And with that, I'm out!
