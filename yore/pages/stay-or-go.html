I have a big decision to make pretty soon.  Once May rolls around and my roommate goes to London, I can either stick around in my two-bedroom luxury super sized apartment, or I can go out and fend for myself, assuming that I am still employed.  Otherwise, the choice will be pretty simple: box on the street; that is, if the rent for boxes on the street are not too high these days.

However, assuming everything is going well in terms of income in the coming months, the choice is still fairly complicated.  There are a few things I worry about now (all of which make me feel old, but hey.. whatever):

<i><b>Sanitation</b></i>

For the past four years, I have been living with roommates whose idea of interior decorating is stacking enough pizza boxes up to make something that resembles, but smells rather worse than, say, an endtable.  Building furniture out of used, smelly cardboard is fine by me, and living in an environment that is somewhat less ritzy is okay too.  I would, however, like to sit on the sofa occasionally without wading through a sea of Twinkie wrappers (wrappers with Twinkies still in them are a different story).

<i><b>Noise Level</b></i>

Typically, anything under 100 db is okay with me.  Once you get above that noise level for over an hour, I start to get a bit irritated.  For example, one of my neighbors owns a really large SUV; the kind that you're sure he could only acquire through the income of selling drugs or something.  If the SUV isn't big enough, the speakers in it are.  Technically, you'd have to be sealed in a lead box orbiting a planet in another galaxy not to be able to hear this guy's speaker system.  When he parks out right outside my window at 2:00 a.m. on Monday morning, books fall off my shelf.  My theory is that the worse music is, the louder you have to turn the volume up to enjoy it.  That goes right along with the fact that if a song only contains one chord, it can be defined as bad.  I think that the music he listens to was all generated by a computer without any human intervention.

...I am digressing...

<i><b>Work Ethic</b></i>

Now, I am just getting picky, but I have had countless conversations with some of my respective roommates that go something like this:

<b>Me:</b> <i>(walking in the door at around 8:00 p.m.)</i> What are you up to?

<b>Him:</b> <i>(sprawled out on sofa, hand down pants, eating cheezits)</i>Nothin.

<b>Me:</b> What have you been doing all day?

<b>Him:</b> Nothin.

<b>Me:</b> What are up doing tomorrow?

<b>Him:</b> Nothin.

Is this a college town or a temporary dumping station for young people who do nothing for four years?  And exactly how does one get by when one's work ethic consists of eating spam and watching the Game Show Network sixteen hours a day?  In any case, a roommate that is ambitious and busy or even just has a job, or simply goes to class once a month would be A-OK.  Or maybe a dog.

In any case, the choice still remains of sticking around this joint or going solo.  I think the fact that, while I am typing this, I hear a guy (most likely my roommate) and a girl (who knows) in the other room giggling and making spanking noises tips the scales a little bit.
