It is not unusual for things to come careening off of the balcony above my first floor apartment.  After all, the mathematical probability is certainly favorable.  There are two floors above my apartment, meaning that the odds are doubled in favor of things falling from above, but lately the situation has grown a bit ludicrous.

To relay one example in particular, last weekend, I was taking the opportunity to sleep in (i.e. sleep past 7 a.m.), when, at around 7:30 a.m., I heard an earth-shattering thud  that jostled me form my sleep and caused me to abruptly sit up.  The entire apartment shook.  My first thoughts were that (a) Armageddon had come, (b) somebody was getting shot again, (c) the building had finally started to collapse in on itself, or (d) all of the above.  Needless to say, I took the appropriate action of proactively going back to sleep and hoping that whatever it was (murder, me being crushed by the weight of three floors, or Armageddon), it wouldn't wake me up again.

Later on that morning, I ventured outside of my apartment to find a full-sized, six foot long, two-hundred pound air-conditioning compressor sitting outside my door.  Signs of destruction were eminent.  It nearly toppled and obliterated a small tree outside my door.  I was thinking that if I had happened to have walked outside my apartment at the wrong moment, I would have been irreversibly flattened.  That fact aside, however, I immediately began to contemplate what series of events led to the displacement of the oversized compressor from its usual place of residence (i.e. inside the wall in the third-floor apartment) and its eventual relocation to outside my front door.

This, of course, involved the factoring in of data regarding previous things that have made the twenty foot drop from above me, including, but not limited to, liquor bottles, full cans of spam, plastic furniture, full sized watermelons, and living humans (okay, the last of these happened at a different apartment complex, and that's another story), etcetera.  The only thing that I can think of is that there must be some anomaly of nature up there that periodically causes things to be whisked out the door and come flying down off the balcony.

Either that, or there a lot of drunk guys up there.

Probably the latter.

But you still have to wonder how and why somebody managed to dislodge an entire air conditioning unit and give it a new home in front of my door at 7:30 in the morning.

Yeah.

Weird.
