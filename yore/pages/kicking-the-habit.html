title: 'Kicking the Habit'

My friend and colleague, Mike, today was telling me about his resolution to give up one of his favorite habits: cigarettes.  I asked him how long it had been since he had a smoke, and he replied nonchalantly, "last night".

He is one of many of my friends who has made the resolution to quit, and that "this time" will be <strong>the time</strong>.  I hope so.  But, sadly, I don't think I have ever witnessed a successful kicking of the cigarette addiction among any of my friends both presently and in the past.

This, of course, got me thinking about the fact that <em>I</em> had never had a cigarette in my life, and how I was too <em>smart</em> to become addicted to something that drains wallets, screws up braincells, almost guarantees lung cancer, and annoys almost all non-smokers (as a matter of fact, most of these points have been pounded into me over the last two decades by countless anti-drug campaigns in just about every level of my education from kindergarten to graduate school).  As a result of this succesful societal training, I always have a natural inclination to feel superior to those trying to stop an addiction that I was too informed to begin in the first place.

Then I remember coffee.

Ahh, coffee, my own personal weak point.  It feels pretty stupid telling somebody that it will be "easy" to give up an addictive habit like smoking as we sit and talk over a cup of coffee -- my third of the day.  It's like the addicted leading the addicted down the road to Addiction land, where cigarettes grow on trees, the rivers are made of booze, and caffiene makes up more of the atmosphere content than nitrogen does (some people I know would consider this place paradise).  All of the sudden, my feeling of superiority and supreme self-control goes right out the window.  In fact, Mike is one step ahead of me in the process of overcoming the addiction -- he actually <em>wants</em> to give up the abusive substance.  I, on the other hand, wander around the building where I work in the morning with an empty mug looking for unattended decanters without regard for my health.

Okay, maybe it's not that bad.  But, who am I to tell Mike that cigarettes are bad for him when I'm at the same time guzzling down a liquid that, according to the Internet (which means these facts <em>must</em> be true):
<ul>
	<li>increases nervousness</li>
	<li>increases stomach acid production</li>
	<li>induces restlessness and nausea</li>
	<li>encourages ulcers and acid reflex disease</li>
	<li>causes hypertension</li>
	<li>etcetera</li>
</ul>
Reading the bad things that coffee can do to you is definitely motivation to toss out the cup I'm currently drinking, but tomorrow, when some pretty girl says, "let's get a cup of coffee", I'll already be in line at Starbucks before she has even finished letting the last syllable come off her tongue.  Heck, it doesn't even take that much cajolery.  When the big, fat network administrator guy says, "up for a coffee break?", I'm already on my second cup by the time he gets to the end of his sentence.

It is definitely hard to give up something that you teach yourself to enjoy so much that you have recently bought a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/science/2891/">shirt that features a caffeine molecule</a>. [note to self: why did I publish this fact on the Internet?]

So, the next time Mike says that he's having trouble giving up cigarettes, I'll be a little less judgmental.

Instead, I'll just take him out for a cup of coffee.
