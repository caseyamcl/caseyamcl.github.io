Since I got back from Spain, I've been trying to better my life.

My friends and family would be proud of me on several points: In the past month, I've drunk(are you ready for this...) TWO cups of coffee.  Again, I have drunk only <strong><u><em>TWO</em></u></strong> cups of coffee!  Small Cups!  That's like a 3520% decrease in caffeine consumption from last month.

Also, I've been getting up and swimming in the mornings before the sun comes up.  I know, I know... Unbelievable.  The Marathon is coming up, so I figure I'd better do something about it.

But, with all these life advancements, I've also a few small--how shall I say--challenges.  After reading some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399152601/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/102-4589456-4454522?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155">scary literature</a> about American food processing while on vacation, I've been trying to eat better.  For instance, instead of microwave burritos every day for lunch, I'm planning to cut back to four or five times a week.

No seriously, no human being could eat those things that many times and live to tell about it.

So what I have I done in the gastronomic department?  Well, I went shopping in the hippie section--err, I mean healthy section--of Publix for the first time a few weeks ago.  Everything is the same in the hippie--err, healthy--area, except the boxes contain much fewer ingredients that have more than six syllables, which is good, because I like to know what I'm ingesting.  Oh, and the boxes usually like to indicate somewhere that the cow/pig/emu/etc. contained therein was given a healthy, carefree life and treated like royalty all the way up until it was brutally slaughtered for you to eat.

Ahem.. excuse me; it seems I've been spending too much time in the "Health Living" area of the store.  It must be rubbing off.

Anyhow, I've also been getting fresh produce, which is great and all, but it has led me to a scary a realization.  If you buy real food, it (in fact) has to be <em>prepared</em>.  This is the point where I am reminded of the giant intellectual chasm in my brain where all those culinary skills I should have learned when I was growing up would normally be.  Unfortunately, I know only about five recipes, which I dutifully shared with the world a few years ago on a <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/2004_02_01_weblog_archive.php#107735295287671556">prior post</a>.

<a href="http://wovenandspun.blogspot.com">Anna</a> has been trying to help me learn about this facet of living, but our cooking time together usually ends up with her looking me at sorrowfully and then doing everything herself.  "You can wash the spinach," she says.

"Gee, really?!  Shucks, now I'm just like Wolfgang Duck, or whatever his unfortunate name is!"

I have been working at it, though, and I am happy to report that, out of the 10 real meals I've prepared in the past few weeks, only five have been complete disasters!  Last night was the doozey, though.  As a consequence of my fine cooking, I ended up waking up this morning at 5 a.m. with the Hiroshima of stomach aches.  The pain was searing, and it lasted nonstop for about four hours, leaving me out of work for most of the day today.  That'll learn me to stop eating canned chili!

In addition to all that, I'm learning about all of these new, expensive tools you need to buy in order to cook, like a "saucepan" and a "mixing bowl".  Sheesh, a microwave burrito requires (get this: ) a microwave... End of story.  But if you want to make a salad (not the kind that comes pre-packaged in a box), you need to have handy several good knives, some mixing bowls, a vegetable peeler, a colander, etc. ad nauseum...

I if were to objectively gauge the results of my cooking endeavors based on my health and recent expenses, I would definitely be inclined to revert to my frozen pizzas. BUT!  I am not giving up on this pursuit!  I am strong!  I am going to eat real food if it kills me, which, judging by my track record, should happen either tomorrow or the day after.

Now, I'm going home to make some more crap.  Wish me luck, because I'm going to need it!  Until next time, cheers.
