Every night that I go running at the track at the University, there is always the same old man out there jogging.  He's always wearing the same tattered shirt, wearing a somewhat dated headset, and barely moving.  He is jogging, but he's pressing forward much slower than even the people around him who are walking.  He's there, though, every single night.

When I get to be his age, I want to be just like him.

When I was in high school, we had a teacher there who was respected almost as a god among teachers.  He was an incredible instructor; something that you don't run across very often these days.  He was in his 60's or 70's; it was hard to tell.  Every afternoon after class, he would strap on leg weights and a full hiking backpack, and then he would proceed to do stadiums.  He always preached thee three "D's", determination, dedication, and (self) discipline.

What's more, he epitomized them in his actions every day.

I know a man who is slowly working on 90 years of age.  He has been put in a nursing home no less than three times in the past two or three years, and he has escaped, in a manner that would make Alexandre Dumas proud, no less than twice.  This man is a musician, and although most of his audiences consists of nursing home inhabitants these days, he continues to perform -- just as he did when he was a member of Glenn Miller's orchestra several decades ago.

He's a role-model if there ever was one.

These people aren't endowed with any special or supernatural gifts; they just know how to live.  They know what their goals are, and they'll apparently defy the odds to otbain them.  They seem to know something about human potential that many of us haven't caught on to yet.

It's a matter of determination.

My friend Keri, while we were running the other night, stated quite capricously, "I want to run a marathon one day."

I asked, "When do you think you'll be ready?"

She said, "Oh, I could run it right now.  Muscles are just tools," she pointed to her head, "the ability to do it is all up here -- that's what training is for."

It's just a matter of confidence.

So, I decided to see if she was right.  I haven't run three miles in over two years, and I've always known that if I tried, I'd probably keel over afterwards clutching my stomach and moaning incohenrently.  I told myself I'd run three miles that night, just to see if I could.  As a rounded the 12th lap, I felt better than I had all month.

I guess these people are really onto something.
