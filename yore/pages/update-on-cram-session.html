It's now hour five of my marathon term paper "finalization", and I am working on the conclusion.  Here is an exerpt from paragraph #311:
<blockquote>It is evident, regardless of the arguments for or against the classification of ethnocentrism, that some form of organization scheme based upon vocabulary (since the Wikipedia entry is in textual form) is necessary in order to collocate the document within the vast and often disorganized realm of cyberspace.  Ethnocentricity can either be explored as a topic in and of itself or as a topic relevant to the various other subjects that the concept applies to, and thus, there are number of different ways of locating the particular document explored in this assignment, as well as other similar documents..  I am just typing now, because I am trying to fill up space.  Currently, I am up to about 3,567 words in this paper, which is all good and well, because while I have been hashing out the past 310 paragraphs, I have really been thinking about things like, "where can I get a good burger after I am done with this?" or, "I wonder what would happen if I crammed a pencil up both nostrils and blew really hard," among various other topics.  Seriously, the words are just kind of appearing on the screen; I think my fingers have little brains embedded in them that switch on every time I need to write a research paper, but anyhow (ahem) there is no clear cut way to search for a document, and therefore, some system of control needs to be implemented in order to facilitate the researchers' needs no matter what approach is taken to locating material in a particular information system.</blockquote>
I am happy to report that I am almost finished!  Whew, it's been a long one...
