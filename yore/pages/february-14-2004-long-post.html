Tonight was one of those nights.

Life starts to happen when you take the initiative to actually walk out your front door and experience things with other people.  Perhaps it is simply my memory convincing me facts of life that are not necessarily true, but I have noticed that some of the most interesting and memorable events occur when you least expect them to.  Tonight was one of those nights.

Had it not been for my good friend, Brian, convincing me to go out, I might just as well stayed home and continued to work on my resume and graduate school application, maybe scan some documents, and read some material for class.  I might even have gone to work for the night.  Instead, he told me I ought to pick him up and hang out since it was in fact a holiday, and both of our respective roommates were entertaining certain particular guests of a female nature.  In all actuality, we were actually banished from our apartments.  Brian's roommate told him not to come back until after eleven.  Mine was a little more hospitable about his request.

"You can stay here if you want, but just try to keep a low profile."

I decided I'd rather have my eyes sucked out by a leaf-blower, so I left.  I drove my '92 Saturn over to Brian's, which was a bad idea, considering the fact that it, technically speaking, had no gas.  At the time my car was actually working, and the gas meter seemed more of a suggestion than an actual necessitative indicator.  I soon learned how crucial gas was when we were hiking up to the fuel station a half hour later carrying an empty gas-can.  On the way there, we witnessed an automobile accident happen right in front of us, and proceeded to conclude that it was probably not going mine or his night.  Eventually, after much trial and tribulation in actually getting the gas from the gas container into the car, the Saturn was running, and I vowed not to be ignorant again by disregarding the gas gauge.  We headed off to Zaxby's, where I ate gasoline-flavored chicken, gasoline-flavored fries, and gasoline-flavored, toast.

Then we headed out into the middle of the woods.

The story is as follows:  Somebody had clued Brian in to a "contra-dancing" event, which I originally thought was some kind of sacred Native-American sacrificial ceremonial thing.  In other words, I had my doubts about the nature of what I was getting myself into.  The cynicism increased when we turned off of the main highway onto this narrow backroad, which led straight out of town into the middle of the Apalachicola National Forest.  We followed the road for what seemed forever as we went deeper and deeper into the middle of the dark North Florida woods.

Brian indicated, "We're looking for a little tiny, hard to see dirt road on the right several hundred yards past a yellow sign, but it's going to be hidden pretty well because of the thick canopy".

Yeah, no problem.
We turned around only about four or five times absolutely sure that we had gone too far and that there was no way that this event could be so far out.  Then we said, "what they hey" and turned back around again every time, determined, for lack of a better goal, to find this place or drive to Georgia, whichever came first.  It took me about forty minutes before I finally spotted a little glowing light shining through the trees off of the road.

As we made our way down a dirt road that resembled the Amazon-trial more so than a place to drive a car, the light grew larger and turned into a wooden dance hall with screen windows and Christmas lights strung up.  From the outside, it looked as if hundreds of people were crammed inside this little backwoods hall.  We parked the Saturn, got out and proceeded to enter the building.  We had apparently found the place we were looking for, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.

Picture, if you will, a 19th century backwoods town gathering, and add a few modern convinces such as water coolers and electric lights, and that should describe the situation fairly well.  We had walked into a scene from the past.  It was like something out of 'Oklahoma'.  There was a small makeshift stage with a band consisting of several musicians.  One was playing the fiddle, another the guitar, and a third was on the mandolin, or so I believe; it was rather hard to see or hear the band through the amazingly dense crowd packed into the small structure.

There was a man with an extremely long beard on stage wearing overalls shouting out commands in time with the music: "Doe-see-Doe" and "Swing your partner round n' round" and "new partners, let's go".  The entire room was a dance floor; hundreds of people were flying around the dance floor in a chaotic, yet methodical fashion.  Scattered around the edges were children and people of all ages clapping, eating, and generally giving off the vibes of having a good time.

An old woman took five dollars from me at the door and asked if I wanted to join their e-mail list.  I graciously declined and proceeded to stand at the edge of the room watching people appear to have more fun than one can possibly imagine.
The first thing I noticed was how young everybody was.  One might expect a bunch of backwards, woods-dwelling, hillbilly rednecks (not to stereotype...) to be the primary patrons of events such as these, but the reality was that most of the people there were in college.  Most of them were my age.  Almost all of them went to FSU.  And there were about two girls to every guy.  I had never imagined that college students would choose to do this on Saturday night, but then again, I, myself was there.

Brian and I quickly met up with his friends, most of whom I know pretty well, and before the next dance started, I was told I'd better join in "or else".  So, for the next two hours, I got a first-hand lesson in barn-dancing.

The dances are actually choreographed so that everybody dances with just about everybody else in the room at least once before the music stops.  Each person chooses a partner, and everybody dances in groups of four, two couples per group.  Throughout a musical number, each couple switches groups a dozen or so times so that by the end of the piece, everybody has danced with just about everybody else at least once.  It's very fast-paced and very dizzying at first, but it's something that you just have to experience to really understand why people do it.

The first girl I got partnered with was a girl named Molly, who happened to be a local celebrity at this event, being that it was her birthday.  She knew exactly what she was doing, and I had no clue what I was supposed to do.  Fortunately, this type of dancing is fairly simple, and it didn't take long for me to not look like a complete klutz.  After a few minutes, I had the routine down, and I started to really get into it.  With each new partner, I was surprised to see more and more people I knew who had made the trek out to the middle of the woods.   Apparently, this event was a little more popular than I had originally realized.

The rest of the night went by in a blur.  Everything was great until the band leader said, "Alright, now we're going to play a waltz; everybody find yourself a partner."  Before I knew it, I was standing in the middle of the dance floor surrounded by exclusive couples dancing all around me.  I decided I would have to get out of there and assume a position on the sidelines to wait it out.

"Find yourself a partner!" Brian shouted at me as he waltzed by, girl in tow.  I kind of shrugged with that nonchalant look of "whatever".  Just then, a short, blond-haired girl strolled right by me, brushed up against me, turned around and smiled.  For about a half a second, we looked at each other, then she turned around and kept walking.  It was a silent charade; she was asking me to ask her to dance, and I had failed.  Apprehensiveness got the better of me at that moment, and she simply walked off to dance with somebody else.  I spent the rest of the night pathetically and desperately trying to make up for it.

Later on, during a fast-paced, change-partners number, I eventually got to dance with her for a short moment before another change-off.  I shouted, "What's your name?" and she told me.  "What's yours?" she shouted back, and I told her.  That was it.  Partners changed, and she was on the other side of the room before I could get another three words out over the crowd and the music.  Every now and then, through the chaos of the ever-growing crowd, we'd catch a glimpse of each other and I'd smile.  She'd smile back.  Then the crowd would swallow us again.

I never did quite make up for my failure to ask her to dance, though, and I spent the last dance of the night standing on the sidelines with some friends watching her waltz with somebody else.  Brian leaned over and said, "You should go interrupt them.  What do you have to lose?"  What <i>did</i> I have to lose?  "Nah," I said, "doesn't that guy know what he's getting himself into?  Girls are nothing but trouble."  I instead just stood there, humbled by my own lack of initiative, as I watched her give him her phone number.  Brian slapped me on the back of the head, and we eventually took off and headed back to modern civilization.

They are holding another dance in a month, and one thing is for sure; in one month, I intend to show that guy who the better dancer is.  Besides, everybody has nights when, despite the fact that things didn't go completely according to plan, you still had a great time and were sure glad that you didn't stay home (especially considering the fact that I would have been listening to my roommate and his girlfriend giggle and stuff shrimp into each other's mouth (vomit)).  Tonight was one of those nights.
