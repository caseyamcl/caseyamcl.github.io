One of my friends got married a few weeks ago... This makes what, five or six now?  I'm only twenty-one.  Apparently, everybody is jumping off the edge of that cliff these days.  Of course, with the whole concept of marriage comes that "special day", and I've been to quite a lot of those lately.  So, as you can tell, I'm a veteran at this whole attending-the-wedding thing, and I've learned a thing or two about how to conduct myself at these events.  So, in the spirit of sharing my infinite wisdom about such events, I publish here for you...

</center><em>Rule One: Don't Say Stupid Things</em>
I cannot stress this one enough.  While it sounds simple, you would be surprised at the sheer number of forbidden phrases there are.  Here is very short list of examples:
<ul>
	<li>"Ya think the Minister really believes all that 'love is' crap??"</li>
	<li>"Wait... this is a <em>wedding?</em>"</li>
	<li>"What are you guys thinking?"</li>
	<li>"Good, luck, you guys."</li>
	<li>"Hey, [Groom's Name], I think that bridesmaid is checking you out."</li>
	<li>"We were taking bets on whether you [the Groom] would actually be here; I guess I lost.  Way to go man!"</li>
	<li>"So, what are you two doing tonight?"</li>
	<li>"[whip cracking noise]"</li>
</ul>
<em>Rule Two: Do Not Do Stupid Things</em>
There is infinite number of stupid things that you can do at a wedding..  Just a few, for example, are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Don't pour any sort of alcoholic beverage into the punch.  Despite the overwhelming temptation, do try to avoid this...</li>
	<li>Cutting in the buffet line at the reception is a no-no, despite the fact that it moves slower than mitosis.  Definitely don't cut in front of the bride & groom.</li>
	<li>Decorating" the bride's father's car instead of the bride's car.. yeah, this can be really, really bad.</li>
	<li>Don't come to the wedding inebriated.</li>
	<li>Do not run around screaming "FIRE!! FIRE!!! GET OUT NOW!!" no matter how tempting it is.</li>
	<li>Do not leave to use the bathroom in the middle of the ceremony."</li>
	<li>Do not eat any of the cake before the bride and groom have.  Apparently and oddly enough, there is a designated time for this.</li>
</ul>
<em>Rule Three: Do Not Buy Stupid Gifts for the Bride and Groom</em>
Gift giving is a very ritualistic and methodical tradition.  Usually, the wedding couple publishes a list of things they want so as to make it easier on their family and friends in terms of gift-getting and giving.  However, sometimes they leave it entirely up to you, so you must be careful in selecting what to get for them.  Here is a short list of examples:
<ul>
	<li>Any living animal</li>
	<li>Duct tape</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stupid.com/stat/OCDG.html">This</a></li>
	<li>Remote control farting machine</li>
	<li>Weapons of any kind</li>
	<li>$10.00 Gift Certificate to Al's Discount liquors</li>
	<li>JELL-O, pudding, bacon, Ramen, or instant-grits.  In fact, most food products should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
The lists go on, but you get the general idea.  With your help (i.e. sitting in your own little corner, shutting up, and quietly waiting for the buffet to begin), the whole day should go excellent, without any major catastrophes for the happy couple, the wedding party, and you won't be shunned, excommunicated, or arrested, and this is a good thing for everybody.

That's all for now.  Cheers!
