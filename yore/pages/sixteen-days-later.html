I have promptly forgotten exactly what point in time I was counting days from, but why should that matter?  It is sixteen days after... something... and I'm feeling pretty good.  That's all that matters.  It's a nice cool Tallahassee fall day (90 degrees in the shade), the workload is rather minute here at my internship, and I have no coarsework due for about a week.  What a contrast from the eight days that have preceeded this one.

It is not just myself who feels this way, either.  The people here in the office are acting amiable, laid back, and generally good spirited.  The Wendy's drive-thru lady seemed to almost be pleased to "serve me".  People were even kind of respectful on the phone at work this morning.  Yes, even the attorneys in the world seem pretty content.  With all of this complancy going on, I cannot help but wonder what in the name of God is going on around here?

I've already ruled out the possibility of some chemical agent being released into the atmosphere around the Tallahassee area, and I've ruled out the probability that everybody actually is, in fact, in high spirits using this statistical Equation:
<blockquote>P = { Probability that Everyone is Actually Happy }

(Number of People) *2 / 4 (Current Happines Level)^2
P =  _____________________________________________  = .000000000001

(Usual Amount of Happiness) - 2 /3 * (Standard Z-Score * 2.04)
____________________________________________

(Social Security #) *(Crankiness Factorial) * 2 / 5 - 3.23</blockquote>
As can easily be seen, there is logically no way on Earth that these people, who I encounter on a daily basis, can be so unanimously content.  The mathematics prove it, common sense proves it, and I have been driving myself nuts trying to explain this phenomenon.

The only thing that I can come feasably come up with is the following explanation, which is a chain of events that led to this unnatural state of affairs:

Shoot, my boss is coming.. I have to go back to work.
