If you have perused this site any, you might recall a prior post that I wrote dealing with a very interesting Internet application, <a href="http://www.20q.net/">20q.net</a> which uses artificial neural network logic to try to guess what you're thinking about based upon your answers to generic questions.  It is startlingly accurate.
