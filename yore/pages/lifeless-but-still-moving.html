I was going to post something about my life tonight, when it dawned on me:  I don't seem to have one.  I spend most of my life these days in Work Land, even the weekends.  Even my boss--nice guy, in reality--is telling me to stop working so much.  Actually, it's more like this: "Hey Casey, you should take some time off.  By the way, can you analyze the entire department's technology needs for the next five years and have it ready by Monday?"

I pick on my coworkers too much; it's time to pick on my roommate, which leads me, in perfect segue form, to my next point:

My roommate, like me, has no life either.  Still, we have nothing much in common except we both have unhealthy addictions for fudge rounds, bad Adam Sandler movies, and Uma Thurman.  Just kidding on that last one.. it's really Reese Witherspoon.  We also both drive run-down beat up cars with no desire whatsoever to actually replace them anytime in the near or distant future.

The thing is, though, that we are pretty darn different.  I like to work too much; Jason, on the other hand, does not share this same overenthusiastic drive.  He, instead, prefers the electromagnetic glow of the television to most other activities, including going to school, working, eating, using the bathroom, or breathing too heavily.  He does, however, occasionally, talk to the television.  I fear that I will one day have to have "the talk" about how those people on the t.v. aren't his <i>real</i> friends, just some actors hired to play coffee-dwelling yuppies in New York.

So, it's always a bit tenacious around this apartment.  There's me, pecking away and my computer keyboard, and in strolls Jason:

Jason (cigar in mouth; holding a half eaten twinkie): "'sup?"

Me (staring intently at a spreadsheet with more numbers on it than I saw in all four years of college combined): "Urgh."

Jason: "Want a twinkie?"

Me (still not listening): "Uh huh; urgh."

Jason: "Are you ever going to pay the rent?"

Me: "I like that."

Jason: "We're getting evicted tomorrow."

Me: "Yes you can."

Jason: "I'm going to go watch television"

Me: "yup"


Riveting, I know.

So, needless to say, we don't get out much around here, unless you count work, which doesn't count, because work doesn't make you more cool.  In fact, I think my personal nerd-to-cool ratio shifts to the left every day I am at work.  But, if work makes you dorky, television makes you dumb.  I'm not sure which is worse: having an immune-deficiency disorder from too much caffeine or creating a permanent indentation in the sofa from lack of movement.

I personally choose to do neither, which is why I am considering taking an Honest-to-God vacation next week.

Maybe I'll go somewhere cool.

Like outside.

Well... Back to work!
