I went to Epcot with the family this past weekend.  Epcot is a great park; it's what the future will look like if the plastic industry somehow manages to take over the world.  The park is supposed to make you "oohh and ahh" over the future-like things they have there; for instance, a giant, 20-story golf ball.

One of the main reasons we were there was for the GM car show that was rolling into Disney that weekend.  Since I'm in the market, Jake thought it would be a good deal, being free and all.

The GM car show is an interesting setup, in that, in addition to just looking at the cars on display, normal folks can actually get in them and drive around.  That's <em>normal folks</em>, like you and I.  At first, my brother and I thought, "You mean, we just sign up for this car show, and we get to drive whatever we want to?!  Awesome!  This must mean we're special."

Of course, it dawned on me that if they're letting <em>me</em> drive cars at the car show, they might be letting <em>other</em> normal people drive cars as well.  Many other people... droves of them... thousands of fat, dumb Disney tourists from places like Flatulence, Nevada aching to get behind the wheel of a Saab or Hummer.  Plus, if they're letting the normal American tourist drive a car, how much control are they really going to give us?

Sure enough, my brother and I waited in line for 40 minutes to drive a Saab.  The word, "drive", however is a bit of stretch.  We got in the car, I turned the ignition on, rolled out onto the track, blinked my eyes once or twice while the car rocketed to 15 mph, and was almost just as soon pulling back into the parking space.  The track must have been about 80 yards long.  I've seen tape measures that were longer.

It was still fun, though.  I proceeded to pass the morning away waiting in line and, when given the opportunity, knocking over as many of those little traffic cones set up along the course as I could.  Epcot was fun, too.  The International Food Festival was taking place while we were there, which means that they had all of these little booths set up around the park serving food from various countries for approximately $5.00 an ounce.

One fairly important item that I'm not sure the Epcot executives considered was the fact that, while it is definitely a good thing to experience foods of different cultures, it may not be the greatest idea, at least gastronomically speaking, to experience them all at the <em>same</em> time.  The shrimp from Australia was good, as was the food from Mexico, but together they formed some kind of green goop in my stomach that immediately took issue with the rest of my anatomy.  Word to the wise: Mexico + Australia = At least three trips to the restroom.  Never travel to, and eat at, these two countries in the same day.

In other entertainment news, I went with some friends last week to see Marat/Sade at FSU.  One of those friends was the assistant director, so I had to be good, quiet, sit still through the show, and definitely <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/2004_03_01_weblog_archive.php#107991582412278975">use the restroom before the production began</a>.  The show was very good, with some stimulating monologues and plenty of crazy people to boot.  The most disturbing portion of the entire show was, in fact, the children's program showing on the television monitors before it began; those of you who have seen Marat/Sade at FSU will know what I'm talking about.  Those crazy cartoon characters still show up in nightmares.

One last retrospection is my question of why there are so many theatrical productions focused on the French Revolution.  I've been involved with or seen four in the past three years alone.  Some of them are about as bloody as they can be (Les Mis), and others actually include singing and dancing while characters are getting their heads chopped off in the street (Scarlet Pim).

It's time to write a script involving the French where they're not killing each other or surrendering to another country in war.  With that, I'm going to go eat some Freedom Fries and a burger.

Okay, that's all for now.. I'm out.
