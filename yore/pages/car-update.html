Thanks to two very laborous and generous members of my family, my car looks good again!  I am in much appreciation and astonishment that no matter how much damage I seem to be able to inflict upon my car, they seem to be able to undo all of it.

The "Saturn fix-up" marathon lasted exactly one week, reaching a climax on Thursday, when my brother and my dad had to wave their arms over the hood for over an hour to keep kamikaze bugs from permanently becoming a part of my car.  Thanks, guys.

Anyhow, despite my brother's instruction of "don't ever drive it over 45 mph again", I am loving the refurbished look.

You guys rock.
