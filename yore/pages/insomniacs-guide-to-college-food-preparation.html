I just got in, and instead of sleeping at this odd hour of the morning, I bring you...

</center><strong>Chili-Mac Supreme (aka Roommate Repeller)</strong>
<em>Prep Time: 20 Minutes</em>
<em>Serves: Two (or one, if you're me)</em>

I'm particularly proud of this recipe, since I came up with it myself.  Basically, you get a can of Super-Chunky Extra-Bean Processed Meat-Product Chili, a box of macaroni, and some pre-shredded Mexican cheese; boil the macaroni, cook the chili, and add the cheese, then mix it together in a large pot.  This recipe has been tried and tested, and roommates won't go near it, so if you have the problem of roommates constantly attempting to steal your food, this is a great one to try.

On the other hand, I don't particularly recommend consuming this mixture if you plan on going on date, or plan on being in the general vicinity of others at all.

<strong>Blender Supreme</strong>
<em>Prep Time: 30 Seconds</em>
<em>Servers One to Fifty</em>

College students who are strapped for cash and low on food will appreciate the economy and efficiency of this recipe.  Gather various edible items from around your apartment that you believe will not be completely disgusting if mixed together (i.e. milk, ramen, sugar, olive oil, ground beef, soy sauce, milk, chicken bones, etc.), place them in a blender, set blender to maximum setting, and blend for 30 seconds.  Pour into cup and enjoy.

<strong>Bread</strong>
<em>Prep time: 0 Minutes</em>
<em>Serves One to Four</em>

One popular and nutritious college recipe that is relatively easy to prepare is bread.  For this recipe, you will need the following ingredients:

(1) Bread

First, obtain a loaf of bread.  Next, open it.  Proceed to eat the bread as desired.  You may share the bread with your others if you are feeling particularly philanthropic.

<strong>Pizza Your Way</strong>
<em>Prep time: 15 minutes</em>
<em>Serves: One to Four</em>

This quick and simple recipe should take you no longer than a half hour to prepare, and it can be quite popular with friends and family.  You will need:

(1)  One Working Telephone
(2)  Ten to Fifteen Dollars in Cash

The most difficult part in preparing this recipe is obtaining the money (cash) to order the pizza.  Some quick tips of places to find cash include:

1. Look on the ground outside -- sometimes there is spare change.
2. Look in your roommate's rooms.  Sometimes they have money.
3. Look under the sofa, in the closet, or underneath your bed.  Sometime there is money there.
4. Look in other people's dorms or apartments.  They may have money, too.

Once you have obtained the cash, you will have to contact a pizza preparation and delivery institution using a (working) telephone.  Consult a directory if you are unsure about this step.

Your recipe should be prepared in fifteen minutes to an hour.

<strong>Roommate's choice</strong>
<em>Serves: One</em>
<em>Prep Time: 5 Minutes</em>

You will not need any ingredients for this one, nor will you need to preheat the oven, use the microwave, or even wash your hands.  You will, however, need three nonperishable items:

(1)  One Match or Cigarette Lighter
(2)  One Paper towel
(3)  One Flame resistant glove

Wait until your roommate has finished preparing whatever it is that he/she has chosen to make for dinner.  When your roommate is not looking, put the glove on your hand, grasp the paper towel in that hand, and then use the match to light it on fire.  Hold the flaming paper towel up next to the fire detector in your dorm or apartment until the alarm begins to sound.  Remove the glove, extinguish the paper towel, and commence making shrieking gestures.  Screaming "FIRE!  FIRE!!" will help speed the process along.

When your roommate has vacated the room, take whatever he or she was preparing and proceed to an undisclosed location.

Well, that about does it...

This blog completely understands the difficulties of obtaining food while attempting to further one's academic career, so I do hope that these Internet-published, completely free recipes can be of help to all college students out there striving to improve their lives and the world around them.
