I haven't really had time to post anything here recently, so I have been extremely delinquent. But I'll make up for it by not writing anything overly boring. We'll just skim over some key highlights from the past two months. First of all....

<center><b>I Moved</b></center>

Everything is better. There are no longer 10 pound spiders outside my door. The living room isn't barren. This apartment is not rainbow colored. The neighbors are cool. The management is sober. Things have improved greatly.

<center><b>I Got A Job</b></center>

I had a job. But I got a new one. The people at this new job decided to give me a notebook computer and a staff parking space on campus. Who wouldn't take it? Plus it's a supervisory position. On top of that I get to say things like "synergy" and "dynamic strategery" all the time without people looking at me funny.

<center><b>I Interviewed Alien Ant Farm</b></center>

Long story, but I met them, and they're pretty cool. Plus, we got to watch their concert from backstage with our exclusive backstage passes. Afterwords, we hung out with them for a few. We also interviewed Chronic Future and some other groups.

<center><b>I'm Still Kicking</b></center>

I'm still running a marathon, still going to Europe, and still in grad. school full time. Oh yeah. Casey is alive, contrary to what this website may imply. That is all for now.
