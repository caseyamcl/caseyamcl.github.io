That's right... It's National Revenue Month*!

<em>(*formerly known as Christmas)</em>

This means that it is time to hit the Malls and go pay for things that you otherwise wouldn't buy in a million years, like baskets of fruit, those sausage-cheese things, and fruitcake.  Then, you have to go buy trees and wrapping paper, and hams and turkeys and blinky lights and--okay, you get the picture.

I, for one, am very proud of myself.   I have not been in the mall--any mall--once since Thanksgiving.  Well, I think I saw a movie a few weeks ago in a mall, but that doesn't count.  It's been great.  I go online, click on a few things, and the boxes are delivered right to my door. I don't even have to get dressed.  In fact, one time I didn't, and the FedEx guy dropping off a package was a little irritated, but what could he do? It's my apartment!  (On that note, I recommend using the no-clothes strategy to deal with carolers, Jehovah's Witnesses, and door-to-door sales people as well.)

I am all organized about this, too.  On my National Revenue Month Checklist, I check off each gift as it comes in:
<ul>
	<li>Plastic Sausage-Cheese Package (x4)</li>
	<li>Fruitcake (x2) - Those really disgusting kinds with the walnuts in them</li>
	<li>Miniature Trampoline (for Anna)</li>
	<li>Puppy and Espresso for my five-year-old niece</li>
	<li>BB Gun for my six-year-old nephew</li>
	<li>Olive Garden Gift Certificate for my sister's finance, who works at Olive Garden</li>
	<li><em>etc.</em></li>
</ul>
Yes, NRM is also called the season of giving, and, as you can see, I am feeling very generous.  I am also giving myself a little some'n some'n.  A new computer, that is.  After three years, my old AMD Athlon will be no more.  I am upgrading to a new <a title="Shuttle Computer" href="http://global.shuttle.com/Product/Barebone/SN27P2.asp">Shuttle SN27P2</a> with all kinds of goodies thrown in.  I get to order it this weekend :)

So, happy Revenue Month, and may all of your money spending go well, whether it's a trampoline for your girlfriend, a fruitcake for your brother (who hates fruitcakes), or a computer for yourself.
