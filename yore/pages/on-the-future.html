title: 'On The Future'

The Future is, of course, something that we all live, and for many, it seems to be a very difficult thing to cope with... especially for people my age, whose futures are far reaching and completely unwritten.

After all, graduating college is like stepping from the light into the dark.  For your entire life you know exactly where you'll be and what you'll be doing in the future.  Then, suddenly, [bam]... you are out there, and now that you are away from college, you have no idea where you'll be and what you'll be doing next month, year, decade... For the first time ever, you not only have to figure out <i>what</i> you are going to do, but also how you are going to do it.  In all the positive graduation speeches you hear, rarely are you exposed to this kind of talk.

It's a scary proposition: personal leadership.  After all, how can one be expected to form a strategic plan for one's own life when he or she has had all major life choices decided by others thus far in life?  Personally, since high school and before graduating college, I had to make only three major strategic decisions: (1) "where do I want to go to college?", (2) "what do I want to focus on", and subsequently, (3) "do I want to continue my program as a graduate student?"  Making these decisions was like simply choosing among well-laid, well-marked paths to travel down.

Then I graduated, and like many people, the uncertainty that I faced was terrifying.  So, I played another card, and chose graduate school... another two years of relative certainty.  Despite that choice, it was somewhat by reputation, somewhat by fate, and a little by personal tactical decision making (emphasis on "tactical") that I found my way into my first full-time job.  That was exactly one year ago.

Since then, I have risen to a slightly higher in my department, a role that requires a hefty amount of decision-making and an infinite amount of uncertainty, which is something I am still learning to cope with.  Now, I am forced to think bigger -- not just about myself, not just into tomorrow or next month, but far into the future.  I am often forced to make decisions without adequate data, or, worse yet, without the experience and knowledge needed to gather data that may be available.  I decide things not only for myself, but in part for the infrastructure of an entire organization.

I have to think about what I am going to do to not only survive, but reach my personal goals (which, of course, leads one to ask, "do I really <i>know</i> what my personal goals are?), and I have to determine objectives and plans to reach them for the organization for which I am a part of.  It is often daunting; some of the technology that I am building a system around I have never even heard of before.

It is understandable the anxiety that we face as young people graduating from college and entering a world of uncertainty.  Those well-cut, well-trodden paths developed for us as students seem a long way behind me even now, a year after graduation.  For even the smallest decisions, answers may be elusive, and the necessity to rely on instinct becomes a reality.

In the sense that entities, people included, often find and take the path of least resistance and of greater security, many people attempt to avoid decision-making.  Some take jobs where personal growth is not a necessity; some seek relationships that are born out of immediate availability; some cope with doubt by artificial means.  Breaking free of the inclination to gravitate to the easy solution or simple paths is where leadership comes from--it is an act of effort as much as it an act of spirit.

As the leaders of tomorrow become the leaders of today--as we step into a world of darkness and uncertainty--I hope that we are able to have the courage and judgment to face uncertainty, think strategically, fulfill our potential, and to provide light to those who will face the same challenges in the future.
