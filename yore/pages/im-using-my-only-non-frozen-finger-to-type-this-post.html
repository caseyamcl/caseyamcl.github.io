Hello from New York State, where you can freeze your hand to the side of a building without any effort whatsoever.  My friend Brian are here with some friends that we know in NYC spending Thanksgiving attempting to not catch hypothermia.

Yesterday, we went to the Macy's Day Parade and accidentally knocked over a balloon (oops, Danielle).  The other thing we did at the Parade was stand in the middle of Columbus Square and try to not freeze.  The wind chill was in the negative 200's, but the actual temperature was only merely in the negative 150's.  We had a good time when we were able to scrape enough ice of our pupils to see anything.

It was definitely good times.  Today, we're going back to the city, because we heard it's even colder, and we're stupid.

So, anyhow.  Hope everyone in Florida is having a good time.  Think of me when you're sitting in your bermuda shorts, sipping Koolaid on the beach.

Cheers!
