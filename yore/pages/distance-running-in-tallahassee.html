title: 'Distance Running in Tallahassee'

Tallahassee is known for it's great running atmosphere.  There are literally dozens of distance running sites, so that anybody who trains in this town can pretty much pick out a new site every week.  They're all pretty scenic, too.  I'd say that Miccosukee Greenway is one of the most scenic places I've been in this area of the country.

Some of the best trails around town are:

1. The Cadillac Graveyard Trail - Named for a number of Cadillacs half-buried on the trail out in the middle of the woods after decades of neglect.  It's pretty cool.  The trail takes you right through the middle of two large lakes and into the backcountry on the east side of the city.  Lots of undeveloped space.

2. Miccossukee Greenway - Miles and miles of open countryside taking you into the forest and finally halfway to Georgia.  Beautiful landscape, and it's protected through the Florida Trust for Protected Land.

3. St. Marks Trail - This one is great, because it dead-ends after 16 miles at Posey's Restaurant on the Gulf Coast.  After you're done running, you can sit down and eat some catfish from a woman who insists on refilling your "swate tay" every three minutes, and calls you "sonny" a lot.

This is all good and well, but when I first started running last summer, I had no idea any of it existed.  So, I just ran the track at FSU.  Running the track over and over again definitely has its disadvantages compared to the great countryside around the city.  To compare the Miccossukee Greenway trail to the track:

Consequently, it was pretty boring--and at times, under certain circumstances, gross.  I owe a lot to my good running friend Keri, who actually went out on the <a href="http://www.gulfwinds.org">Internet</a> one day and found some great places to run.  This certainly beat running the track over and over and over and over and over and over... something Keri and I did to the tune of eight miles at a time last summer.  I intend to post some of these great running venues as this site's first <strong>Permanent Feature</strong>.  In the meantime, you can find some (slightly outdated) trail descriptions at the <a href="http://www.gulfwinds.org">Gulf Winds Track Club</a> site.

With that, I encourage everyone to take advantage of the cooler weather and hit the trails; this especially goes for that black-haired girl with the red shorts who runs at Tom Brown Park, wherever you are out there.
