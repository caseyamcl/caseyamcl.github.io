Doth, thine self hasth emergith from the great deep perils of what is commonly referred to as "hell" month here in college, but I like to refer to it more often as The Week of Great Dispair and Doom in Which I Would Rather Be Receiving a Proctosis from a Rabid Squirrel than Continuing on Any More with this Monotony.

Okay, it's not that bad.. But, I have been doing a <i>lot</i> of writing.  I've written so much, I can't even remember most of what it was that actually came up with!  I do have some strange clouded memories of me sitting in the computer lab sifting through page after page of veterinarian sites looking for a specific breed of gerbil (It's true) to incorporate into one of my projects for ..get this.. computer database design class.  (By the way, it turns out that the breed is "Egyptian Gerbil")  Regardless of my information retrieval challenges, I have managed to come out of the term-paper-fray, miraculously, clutching several pieces of paper that I supposedly wrote, and I have turned most of them in to my instructors who will hopefully remember that time that I so graciously brought them their mail or faculty robe, or whatever during my internship here at the school as the errand-dude.

One can only hope.  For now, however, I have to concentrate on the next circle of Hades, the one that comes after final project month.  It is, as the following pictures indicates, <b><u>FINALS WEEK</u></b>!!! mwuhahahahahahahahahahahaha... (sigh) I need a nap.
