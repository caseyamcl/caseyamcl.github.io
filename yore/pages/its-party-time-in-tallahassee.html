...and we all know what that means. All of the natives here come out on Friday night and stand around holding plastic cups with beer in them convinced that they are living the life.

I happened to somehow end up in the midst of one of these "social gatherings" (if that's what you want to call it) recently, so I had an opportunity to see how everybody is getting jiggy with it these days. Things were pretty much as one might imagine: Everybody was just kind of standing, mostly inert, holding their glasses. Now, don't get me wrong; they must have been doing more than simply hording their cups. Everyone there was sufficiently inebriated to the point of near complete barbituation. Apparently, the social part of everybody's brain had been deactivated for the evening.

This party was taking place on the front patio at this on-campus house, and two friends and myself just kind of showed up to it arbitrially. Upon my arrival, my first instinct was to start making friends. This was rather difficult. My "Hey! How's it going?!"'s were met mostly with hazy-eyed dull-witted stares. "My name is Casey," usually solicited a response, but that's as far as things progressed in terms of meaningful conversation. I was approached at one point by a girl who insisted that I pay for "the keg fund" if I wanted to get a glass of beer. I told her no thanks; I would just take an empty glass and hold it. I was pretty sure I'd still fit in, and nobody would really care whether my glass was empty or not as long as I was holding one. Glass holding seemed to be a social necessity in this situation.

Well, I really didn't fit in that well after all. First of all, I still had my wits about me and that clearly wasn't a social norm at this party. Secondly, I didn't have this innate need to examine the screen on my cellular phone every thirty seconds. This, however, seemed to be a popular behavioral trait at the "party". Thirdly, I was probably older than every other person there, even if not by much. As such, I decided that I could better spend my time doing something more interesting, such as counting the number of dots on my ceiling. I found the people who had taken me to the shindig, and we unanimously agreed that we could be doing something more exciting. So, as quickly as we showed up, we left.

I have a feeling that this kind of behavior happens a lot in Tallahassee. And, if so, it's no wonder we lost our ranking as one of the top party schools in the nation. If people are just standing around with cups of booze, not doing anything, I don't really consider it a party; more of a gathering of cup-holding people -- or something like that.

This of course makes me (a) not want to go to another party like that again, and (b) throw one of my own. At my party, if you're caught standing around, inert, holding a drink, you will be kicked out. At this party, we will adhere to the following rules:
<ul>
	<li>If you're caught standing around, inert, holding a drink, you will be evicted from the party</li>
	<li>The music will be good; none of this I'm-a-white-boy-but-I-think-I'm-black so-I'll-play-music-that-nobody-could-dance-to-in-a-million-years stuff.</li>
	<li>If anybody is caught being a total jerk to somebody else, we can have a group-beat-down on that person and stick his head down the toilet <em>(I'm not sure what this has to do with the topic at hand, but it seems like a cool rule)</em></li>
</ul>
Actually, I could throw this party since my roommate will be in London starting <strong>TOMORROW</strong>.Â  That's the best birthday present of all.
