title: 'It''s Synergetastic!'

Lately, work has been a bit stressful, which is appropriate; that is what work is supposed to when you are employed by a "high energy synergetic, fast-paced proactive" institution.  Recently, however, things have been a bit more synergetic and fast-paced than before, causing me to want to go hide under a rock somewhere.

Okay, it hasn't been that bad.  Besides, today proved to be the best Monday in the history of work.  Consider, (1) the company may send me to Epcot for a conference, (2) in our new personnel structure, I am going to play "a central role", and (3) we get to buy a LOT of new technology in the next few months, which is fun.

So, things are good.  Now I just have to get my lingo down.  I still haven't quite grasped the corporate-nonsense vernacular that all of my bosses are using.  Apparently, in order to move up in the world, you have to learn how to speak synergetically, a language which is a lot like English, except the words don't actually mean anything.  What follows is the transcription of a typical meeting:

<b>Boss 1:</b> It seems the FA's are doing quite well.  I sense a lot of positive synergy emanating from them, although there are some interesting dynamics between Steve and Glenda.

<b>Boss 2:</b> Yes, I sense that, too.  I think that Steve could do a better job of aligning his personal vision with that of ours.  If we could just touch base instill a bit more proactive energy into his d-to-d, then I think we'll see a definite increase in his overall synergy.

<b>Boss 1:</b> Certainly.  We can have him do a personal gap analysis, and then just sit down and talk to him in person to work out his issues.  I think that Steve has some strong personal visions for his own growth and development.  We must remember that he is not working for <i>us</i>, he is working for <i>himself</i>.  Right, Casey?

<b>Me:</b> Uhm.... yes, Steve is... a synergetic pro-active, umm, doer of dynamic energy-I mean synergy-between, uh, himself and .... whats-her-face.

<b>Boss 1:</b> Splendid!  That is a great way to describe it.  I would definitely say that you hit the nail on the head by omitting Glenda from your statement; I think the problem is with Steve's personal dynamics in general; not just with a particular team member.  And, the dynamic energy is something that has to be considered for sure.

<b>Me:</b>  Sure.

As you can see, work can be quite confusing at times.  I spend half of my workshift attempting to figure out what it is I said earlier.  Apparently, it really doesn't matter what you say when you speak synergetically as long as you use a prescribed set of words.  I've learned that you can't go wrong with terms like "synergy", "dynamic(s)", "touch base", "proactive", "alignment", "goals", "vision", "mission", or "experiential development".  How you put them together; well, I leave that up to you.  Watch; I can put them all together in the same sentence:

<i>His synergy is definitely reflected in his dynamics with his team since I often see him touching base with them in a proactive way to make sure that their goals are in alignment with the organization's vision and mission.</i>

I have no idea what most of that means, but I bet you if I were to say it at the appropriate time, I would land a promotion.  The good news is, it looks like I will have time to sit down and actually figure this stuff out, since (don't fall out of your chair, here):

<strong><center><u>I am taking a vacation</u></center></strong>

Yep, it's only one day, but I am taking Friday off, which is fine, since I have almost enough vacation time earned to retire.  I am going to go home and perhaps hit the beach in remembrance of the all-to-recent days of my being a full-time student, before the days of proactive synergy.

What did I do back then without strong personal dynamics, anyhow?
