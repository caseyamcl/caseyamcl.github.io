title: 'What a great day to have off.'

I can't remember the last day that I have had more than four hours (usually in the evening or at night) to call my own. Today, I actually got about nine of them. And, it is the first day of spring. So, I did what any good person would do and actually went outside. ..And I was wearing short sleeves...

Not to say that Tallahassee gets really cold, I mean it is still Florida (although, some would argue it's Georgia -- we try to pretend we don't acknowledge those arguments at all), and this winter wasn't really as cold as the last. I still have memories of it being 5 degrees at 7:30 one morning last February. Also, of course, I have friends in Omaha, Nashville, and Vermont who would probably stab me with an ice pick if I were to complain about it being cold in Florida. But, even down here near the Gulf -o- Mexico, we can appreciate the coming of spring.

Now, of course, that means that everybody is going to begin the weeklong workout regimen. I see a lot of this going on, especially among students. It happens basically every January, March, and August.

"I am going to start working out," Typical Student says. So, the next morning, that person, along with 16,000 other persons, gets up at 6:30 a.m. and makes the effort to go running. Then, of course, the next day they are all sore and tired, so they decide to skip the workout and just do it every other day. But then, there's that test coming up in two days, and it's more important to study, right?
"Plus, if I were to go running," T.S. says, "I would miss back-to-back episodes of Ren and Stimpy at eight o'clock."

Then, one week after the first day of spring, the sidewalks are bare as they were all winter. I personally find this kind of behavior extremely ludicrous, self-detremental, and lacking productivity. Therefore, I intend to boycott it completely this year by not doing anything in the way of working out, eating healthy, or otherwise attempting to improve my physical condition one iota. In fact, I think I'm going to ring in the new season by ordering pizza when I home, buying a lot of highly caffeinated soft drinks, and staying up all night to watch Extreme Elimination challenge and program PHP.
That'll show 'em.

...show them what, I'm not exactly sure, but it sounds like a good plan, and with a new season, one must have resolutions.
