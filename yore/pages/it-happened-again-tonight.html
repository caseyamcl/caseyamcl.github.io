title: 'It happened again tonight'

It hasn't happened for a while now, and I was hoping that I could make it through the rest of this semester.  Just six more weeks and I'd be home free.  But, nope.. It caught me by complete surprise tonight.  Things always happen when you least expect them to.

I couldn't stop snickering through the middle of lecture during class tonight.

It didn't help that I had a can of "Mellow Yellow" before class, which is anything but "mellow", as those of you who have had some would know (caffeine per everything-else ratio per 8oz: 10.2 / 1*).  Then, as the professor was going on, I got to thinking about things.

Bad things.  Things that could technically be considered humorous.

For some reason, my brain, at the most inappropriate of times, decided to pull from my memory banks, "dancing Jesus", which is something that I worked hard to repress so that it would not come out at times like these.  If you do search for "dancing Jesus" on Google, you'll find all kinds of different animated .GIF files of Jesus dancing.  ...Jesus doing the Shake, Jesus doing the Lindy Hop, Jesus Doing the macerena, etc...

Not only did my conscious self decide to think about dancing Jesus, but it also decided to find it infinitely funny.  So, I sat there, front and center in the middle of class, trying to hold it all in.  My eyes watered, I was shaking, and I'm sure I went from normal to red very quickly.  I tried as hard as I could not to laugh while sitting in that lecture hall, but anybody who has been in my situation knows that this is almost as difficult as trying to not sleep during an economics lecture.  I thought about getting up and leaving, but I figured if I moved so much as an inch, it would all come pouring out.

So I sat there, with Jesus doing the Macerena inside my head, eyes watering, face turning red, and leg shaking.  One thing is for sure:  It is almost impossible to pretend not to be amused when you do, in fact, think something is insanely funny.  But, in the end, I'm proud to say that I made it through that class without making a <em>complete</em> idiot out of myself.  However, I know that a genuine humor attack can happen anywhere at anytime... while driving, while trying to do homework, while working, while defending your thesis... completely without warning.

Case in point:  Three years ago, I had a severe instance of a Severe Humor Attack (SHAT.) while I was sitting through a systems architecture class.  I was in the front row, and there was very little space between me and the students next to me.  It was while I was sitting in this class one day that something extremely amusing got into my head, and caused me to have a full-grade SHAT.  I was on the verge of howling so bad that I actually had to get up, weed my way through the narrow aisle, displacing several other students, and go out in the hall.  I went directly to the restroom and proceeded to laugh and laugh and laugh so hard that I had boogers shooting out my nose onto the floor.  Then, after I thought that I had gotten it all out of my system, I proceeded to redignify myself and return to my front-row seat in class.

Then, it started again.  Now, not only was I thinking about whatever it was that I found so amusing originally, but now I was also thinking about how funny my present situation was.. a guy sitting in the front row of class, trying to contain himself.  From a third-person perspective, I could imagine, and it made me want to laugh. Evidentially, my problems of self-containment were visible to others as well, because the professor eventually abruptly halted his lecture, sauntered over to me, and said, "What in God's name is so funny, Mr. McLaughlin?"

I froze.

Then, I squeaked, "Funny, sir?"

"You have had an enormous grin on your face ever since class started."

I hadn't realized it was so obvious.  But, now, I had to explain myself in front of the class.  I had to think fast; be on my toes, because I certainly wasn't going to tell what was amusing me to everyone in the class, 30-some-odd guys who were now waiting intently for my revelation, all with giant grins on <em>their</em> faces.  I was put on the spot, and I had to come up with something, since the professor, too, was now staring intently at my suddenly mute self.  Then, I came up with an idea!  The guy outside the classroom window!  The guy on the lawnmower!  Surely he could be the object of my amusement!  That could be funny; yes, but how...?

I stuttered, "The g-guy on the lawn more fell off of it, a-and I thought it was funny."  That seemed like a reasonably humorous situation to me.  Of course, it wasn't true.  The guy hadn't fallen off the lawn mower.

A pause.

The professor, and everyone else, looked outside the window, then looked back at me.

"He's still on the lawn mower," the professor said matter-of-factly, "he didn't fall off."

A pause.

"He, umm, he got back on," I said.

A pause.

Someone in the back of the room coughed.

Then, the professor turned around and proceeded to go on with his lecture, which at this point, I had no awareness of at all.  The interrogation shook me, but it didn't shake my relentless need to laugh.  Now, I had a really <strong>big</strong> problem.  Now, in my head, I had made-up images of the guy outside actually falling off the lawn mower (you know, chasing after it frantically and all, being that it was a self-propelled lawn mower and all), the humor of my situation in general, and, of course, the images that had caused me this problem in the first places--I can't even remember what it was that was so funny, either.

I also don't remember how I made it through the rest of that class with any dignity and sophistication, but I eventually ended up transferring out of that school (for reasons entirely non-inclusive of that particular event, of <em>course</em>).

Anyhow, and conclusively speaking, I do not know if it is only I who have had SHAT attacks, but I have a suspicion that I am not alone.  In any case, you have to be careful about these things for sure.  One more thought on the matter, as well:  This whole laughing phenomenon is extremely contagious.

You're already laughing at me, <em>aren't you?</em>

I'll bet you've already done a search for "Dancing Jesus" on Google, too, haven't you?
