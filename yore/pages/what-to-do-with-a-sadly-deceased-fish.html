Several months ago, my good friend and roommate, Maximilian Antonio Xavier III, a.k.a. Max, unfortunately passed away.  It was a peaceful passing, I hope; I was not home to witness it or comfort him throughout the experience.  I first saw him in his post-mortal state some time after his initial transfiguration floating at the top of the aquarium in a peaceful looking manner.

At first, I thought he was just out for some fresh air, but it later (three days, to be exact) became apparent that he was, in fact, not with the living any longer.  (Apparently you have to <em>feed</em> the fish as <em>well as</em> put it in water ... I'm learning.)

So, the question became, what should I do with my respected and esteemed friend?  I did not want to dishonor his death.  After all, he had been there through the good times and the bad times, and he had faithfully listened every time I had a problem.  (In part, most likely, because he had no way of escaping without committing suicide -- which I am happy to report that he did not even attempt to do ... more than three times, anyways)

My first thought was to bury him outside in the apartment complex, but then I thought about all of the construction they're doing at the place (vis-a-vis the air conditioning units that come barreling down off the third-story balconies).  What if he got chopped up by some tilling machine or something?  We couldn't have that.

So, then I thought about giving him "burial at sea", but flushing your longtime friend (of three months) down the toilet seemed a little disrespectful, especially considering that traditional burial was not good enough.  (Plus, thanks to the recent actions of my larger, less equitable roommate, the toilet was temporarily out of service)

Finally, I came upon my solution:  I would cryogenically freeze Max until such later date in which science would be able to revive him.  Only then will I thaw him out!  So, in the meantime, Max has been living in my freezer.  There have been a few instances of near failure for the project, such as the time my aforementioned roommate said, "What's this?" and then <i>threw him in the trash!</i>  It was fortunate that I was there to rescue him.  In all, though, the cryogenic freezing experience has been going very well (for me at least; I don't know how the deceased fish is taking it)

I believe that Max has a right to live, and (even though he attempted to take his own life by jumping out of his habitat three times) that one day, maybe far from now, we will be reunited as friends!

All will be well.
