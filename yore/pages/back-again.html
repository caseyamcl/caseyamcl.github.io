I haven't been a very good website publisher lately, but it's not <em>all</em> my fault.

Okay, maybe it has been <em>all</em> my fault, but I was traveling through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Illinois.  So I have been a little busy.  I also blame work, which I left directly to fly out for my vacation and drove directly back to after my plane came in after vacation.  So I had a vacation literally sandwiched in between huge spats of working.

Right now I am supposed to be paryting.  Instead, I am working.  Tomorrow I will be working, and on Monday, I'll probably be... working.

You know what's not included in all of that working time?  The answer is, of course, posting to this weblog.  So, bear with me as I struggle through July and the first half of August.

If I don't stick my head into an industrial sized bread-dough mixer before then, I'll be back with you with some pictures in few days.
