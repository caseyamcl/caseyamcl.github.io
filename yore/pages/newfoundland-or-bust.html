Today my friend Brian and I went and had lunch at China King Buffet (whose business plan reflects the Quantity over Quality ideology) and started making arrangements for another set of travel plans in the works.  Not California this time, or New York City, or even Montana.  Nope, this time we're going on a road trip to Canada!  I am still not exactly sure why we're going there in particular, but why waste time with capricious questions like "Why?"

<img alt="Canada" id="image77" class="left" src="/yore/images/>actually,iamprettysurethatbrianissetongoingtonewfoundlandtolookatbirds.he's an ornithologist, and apparently there are <em>different</em> birds in Canada than there are in Florida.  From my perspective, they are all birds.  They fly around, poop on things, and squawk a lot early in the morning; some of them can talk, which is cool.  But, Brian is no ordinary bird enthusiast.  He is hardcore.  He will follow a bird from tree to tree in the forest, trying to discern what the exact species is.  Sometimes, these endeavors will last for hours.

"I thought it was a Southern Small-Backed Yellow-Tailed Quail, but it turned out that it was a Southern Small-Backed King-Tailed Quail!" he'll exclaim, finally having emerged from the forest, as he puts a checkmark in his big-list-of-birds book.

I do not understand this behavior, but then again, I have never met a true scientist or, for that matter, science student, who hasn't been incredibly weird; the fact that I am a science student aside, of course!  In any case, he's going to Canada to look at birds, and I am going to get out of going to work for two weeks.  That, and you can buy things for less money in Canada.  I was in British Columbia for one night with a few people in my family.  I remember my sister running out of a convenience store as if she had just made the greatest discovery of all time.

"You can buy slurpees for, like, thirty-cents in there!"

Oh yeah, and they had free coffee at the motel we stayed at!  You can't beat free stuff.  ...and, getting across the border is no problem.  Basically, somebody sticks their head of the window of a toll booth at the border and asks, "Do you have any guns in your car?"

"No."

"Do you have any nuclear weapons?"

"No."

"Do you have any meat?"

"No."
"Okay, eh.  Have a good day!"  (Canadians say 'eh' a lot, in the same regard that people from South Carolina say 'duh' a lot)
So, since Canada is so cool and has lots of birds and stuff, come May, right after graduation, I will be donning my "Canada Rocks" baseball cap, sewing a Maple Leaf Flag on my bookbag, getting in my car, and driving North until we hit ocean or the car breaks down (we have a running bet on this already).  I'll be sure to bring back some maple syrup or something.
