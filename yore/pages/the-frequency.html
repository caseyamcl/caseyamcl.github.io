..it has slowed for posts to this blog.  Yes, but that is because several things have happened in the recent past, and they are as follows:

1. It's "Final Project" Month here at FSU.  That means that every single instructor of any kind in every class (whether it be Informatics or elementary Algebra) simultaneously assigns a term paper, computer programming project, or other menacing, dubious concoction from the fiery depths of Hades.  So, I've been doing a lot of that.
Somebody tried to steal my car the other night, but they didn't do a very good job, because I still have the car.  In fact, they didn't even steal the stereo, the two-way, or any other valuable commodity that I had stashed in the car, such as the seven and a half pounds of candy pumpkins bought for seventy-five percent off and given to me so graciously by Helen.  They did, however, manage to destroy the ignition switch keyhole in a futile attempt to jam a foreign key into the car to get it started.  Ha ha, stupid criminals.2. The police were very helpful, as well.  "This usually happens on Friday; Odd it happening on a Tuesday and all," the officer pointed out.  I guess that is some kind of advice, but I still haven't figured out what strands of relevance were hidden in his statement.  The apartment complex was very helpful as well when they said, "Bummer."

Regardless, the car is now being repaired at the dealership, and I've been walking a lot of places, which has eaten up a lot of time.  I pulled my bike out last night, and had to take it directly to the bike shop to be repaired also.  I can't have nice things!

3.  My job.  I have been going in there after hours and on weekends.  The secretary and the boss have been calling at odd hours of the evening and asking me things like, "Can you cut one thing and paste it more than once in Microsoft Word?"  I'm not kidding.

4.  Other people have been calling, too!  A lot!  The other night my friend arbitrarily showed up and said, "Grab some food, we're going to a potluck."  Yeah, that doesn' t happen every day.  Maybe there was some girl he was trying to impress there or something.  As it turns out, at a potluck dinner, everybody has to bring a "dish", and considering the selection that I have at my apartment, I really didn't have much to contribute (Ramen and a half pizza).  I ended up taking 2 pounds of candy pumpkins.

5.  The homecoming committee wouldn't let me walk with a sign in the homecoming parade that says "Gorillas are People, Too."  They said that practical jokes are not appropriate and don't exactly reflect what the homecoming parade is all about.  It's okay, however, for some fraternity to have a float depicting some football player from a "lesser" school team being decapitated by our mascot with a guillotine or other such slaughtering device, because <i>that</i> is a reflection of our institutional integrity.  They also said that "Rubber bands last longer when refrigerated."  According to the committee, it makes no sense and is "retarded".  I thought that it would be a useful fact that the public could really make use of.

That's what I get for trying to bring enlightenment to the world.
