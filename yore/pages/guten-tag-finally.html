Wow, I've been a really bad blogger later.  In fact, I've been a bad blogger on many different levels (no posts + tons of comment spam).  Apologies, but it's been a busy month(s)(...)

After Colorado Springs, Atlanta, London, Spain, France, Dallas, Colorado Springs (again), Chicago, and New York this year, I am ready to stop flying on airplanes until maybe next year.  That is, this last plane that I was on actually managed to land
<em>early!</em>  I know... good to stop on a high note.

New York was fun... we got to experience it all.  After spending a few hours wandering in circles in downtown, I got to watch Anna bring out her inner Jew while she haggled over counterfeit purses in a hidden room with a Chinese lady.  I don't know what a Burberry is, but apparently, owning one is very important.  There were also Italian guys trying to act as Italian as possible in Little Italy, in order to attract tourists.  Oh, and, as always, heaping piles of garbage on the streets (it wouldn't be New York).  We also went home to Brian's one night to watch FSU football on television, which was, ironically, occurring four blocks west of where I live.  And there was a haunted chicken coop, with phantom chickens.  Long story...

I also got a tour of what my good buddy Brian does for a living, and just because I know some of you out there in Internet-land sit behind a desk in a fluorescent lighted room pushing TPS reports or some other abomination of man's invention, I think I'll share what Brian's day consists of:

1. Wake up in the haunted chicken coop of doom; perhaps take a shower/perhaps not..  It doesn't really matter.
2. Get dressed and grab some Cheerios.  If the box is empty, stack it next to the giant Cheerios box collection that has been accumulating on floor one of the giant chicken coop.
3. Trudge approximately 150 yards up a hill to a wooden lawn chair.
4. Sit in chair for eight hours and look at the sky.  Count the black dots (hawks).
5. Write down the number of hawks you think you saw on a chalkboard.
6. Pat self on back and collect pay.
