It's almost Halloween, the holiday children and college students who haven't matured past the age of twelve (like myself) utilize as an excuse to consume mind-numbing amounts of sugar.

This year is no exception.

Candy consumption is very important, so instead of wasting hours of time and energy donning ridiculous garments and laboring door-to-door begging senior citizens to spare one piece of candy in hopes of stockpiling enough candy to last a week (roughly eight pounds in gross weight), I discovered a new, more efficient way of obtaining the "goods".  I went to Wal-Mart.

A three pound bag of assorted what-nots cost me about a dollar per pound.  I bought two; one is never enough.  After Helen and I sorted all of the candy into groups, ranked by quality and grouped by type, and after ogling over the novelty of so much sugar on my living room floor, I began to think of ways I could utilize my new acquisition in a practical way.  "How can candy help me get through my everyday rat race?"

Then, I had a revelation.  I don't have a watch, but now I can use candy to help me calculate times, such as, "How much longer is this statistics class going to be?"  The answer is, two-jaw breakers, if the class starts at exactly eight a.m. and ends exactly at eight forty-five.  Well, it would actually be something more like 1.8 jawbreakers, because I'm never quite done with the second one when class gets out.

In reality, using candy-consumption-time as a measuring tool not only eliminates the need for me to constantly check the time, but it also enables me to constantly be doing something I very much enjoy no matter how boring the setting around me is (e.g. work, Information Science class, etc.).  I have been using this system for about a week now, and I have to say that I'm very impressed with the results.  I've even started compiling a list so I know how long certain things take, so I can more accurately allocate my daytime activities.   For instance...
<ul>
	<li>Statistics class:  2 jawbreakers (rounded to the nearest integer)</li>
	<li>Information Science class: 3 jawbreakers</li>
	<li>Database Design Class: 2 jawbreakers and a Tootsie-Roll</li>
	<li>Work:  8 jawbreakers, 2 tootsie-Rolls, and a Lollipop</li>
	<li>Driving Home:  1.3 jawbreakers, 1/2 a Tootsie-Roll, and one of those little yellow gooey things.</li>
</ul>
I'm sure you get the idea.  Candy doesn't just have measurement and enjoyment implications, though.  It can also serve as a reliable device for entertainment, such as imagining the look on my roommate's face when he found approximately 100 of those disgusting little bubble-gums that Helen put in his bed.  Or... Seeing how many of those disgusting little bubble-gums it takes to make a bubble-gum ball approximately 3' x 3' with a solid mass of 8.2 lbs, and then rolling that bubble gum ball down the main walkway during campus rush-hour.  Another good thing to do with it would be to put it on my boss' desk when he's not looking, although it would be kind of difficult to sneak into work.

Maybe I'll see if they will let me take it on an airplane next week.

For now, I have finished my two jawbreakers, three tootsie-rolls, and seven Krisp-bars, thus my time is up to write this post.  In the meantime, if you want to buy jawbreakers in massive quantities, you can go <a href="http://www.candywarehouse.com/jaw25cas.html">here.</a>
