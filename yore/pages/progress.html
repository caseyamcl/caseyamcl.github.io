...versus sanity.  Polar opposites?  It's an arguable point.

I haven't had too much time to get on here and amaze the world with my witticisms lately, because that is physically impossible at the current time.  Our college is being reaccredited by this team of old people, which means that we, of course, have to prepare for their visit.  We've all been putting in 13-hour days getting ready for  five events at once.  Accredidation, this thing called "Code Camp" (as in programming - yes, I know.  That is a pretty dorky name), and a slew of other various projects.

Other stuff is going on, too.  I get to go to another conference next month.  This time in Orlando.  I'm going to learn about stuff like policy writing and being business-like and such.  Apparently, it's a pretty big conference.  I'm just happy, because my hotel room is a block from Pointe Orlando.  Can we say par-tay?

It's all good, though.  I'll survive the next 14-day work marathon, and then I'll kick back with a nice iced tea.  I hear that the variety they serve from Long Island is pretty good.
