Tonight: FIVE MILES!!  I didn't have the opportunity to use the timer, since I was running with a friend, but it couldn't have been too bad.

I have made a resolution to try to run a marathon in February.  So, my friend Keri and are training for that.  It's a lot easier to push yourself when you have a definitive goal.  Next week: SIX MILES.
