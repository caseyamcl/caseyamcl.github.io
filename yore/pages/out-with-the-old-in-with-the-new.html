Hello friends,

After a few faithful years using <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a>, I have cut ties with the service.  Out with the old, I say, and in with the new...

So, now it's all about Wordpress.  As you can see, the design is kinda new, too, but that should not be a novelty for those who have been watching my site, as I change the design about twice a year.
I intend on publishing this, and other, themes in the Wordpress community just as soon as I clean up some of the CSS.  In the meantime, thanks for stopping by.
