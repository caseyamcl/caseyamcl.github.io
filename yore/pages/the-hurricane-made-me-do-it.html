title: 'The Hurricane Made Me Do It'

Hurricane Frances was a devastation, to say the least.  It was a concoction of destruction, wreaking havoc on those unable or unprepared to weather it.  I know many people who have suffered greatly from it.

It has, however, become the universal leverage-factor for people making excuses.

Most people say that the reason they didn't do any work last week was because of the hurricane, but I venture to hypothesize that it is because we are essentially, technically speaking, pretty lazy.  When the guy who I am ordering supplies from says that he forgot to put my order in because of the hurricane, I have this image of him all last week huddled up in a makeshift fort made from bedding and 2x4's with a frying pan and a gun hiding from "Frances".  People talk as if they have been living in a bomb shelter for the past week.

"Why didn't you come to work on Friday, Jeff?"

"The hurricane."

"What <i>about</i> the hurricane, Jeff? It was gone by then."

"It was a hurricane!  What, did you want me to die?!"

My roommate told me that he had no money because the hurricane had come.  This still perplexes me.  Did the hurricane take it from him?  Maybe the hurricane told him to spend it all on beer.  Weather disturbances have a way of doing that kind of thing, if one were to go as far as to personify a change in atmospheric pressure, which I would not put past some individuals.  I know I was thinking about going outside and having a "chat" with the humidity.

Ridiculous digressions aside, however, I do believe that we have a way of blaming our lethargy on whatever is most convenient.  We even afford the privilege to others!  Tonight, in an online class, I told my teammates that I flat out forgot to post a few things to the website last week that I was supposed to get done.  They said, "It's okay.  Ivan and Frances threw everything off."

Yes, I was so greatly disturbed at the prospect of it being windy and rainy, that I was unable to accomplish any intelligible tasks.  It's the hurricane's fault!  Blame the storm!  Blame the storm.  While I can see this benefits in this line of reasoning, such as the lack of accountability for one's own actions, I say we step up to the plate and begin to assume some responsibility!

Let's hold ourselves accountable, people!  Tallahassee is still here, and we, I repeat, <i>we</i> as individuals, are in control.  It's not the hurricane's fault that we don't work - it's ours.

Now, I have to go watch television; the computer told me so.
