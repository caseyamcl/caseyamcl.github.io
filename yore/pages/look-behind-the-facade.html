Whenever somebody walks by my desk, I pick up this blank envelope on my desk and look very seriously at it.  Sometimes I put it in the printer and then take it back out again.  I also take a pen with no ink and pretend to write something on it.  Nobody asks questions; nobody bothers me.  As soon as they leave my realm of worktitude (new word!), I resume reading about <a href="http://www.grudge-match.com/History/flipper-jaws.shtml">this</a>.

It really works!

<em>And...</em>  I typed this up to make it look like I was really pounding out something important:
<blockquote>That status of the ornithological relaxant recurring objects that are seen often running across places like greens on college campuses cannot be anything that anybody has once known ever before in the history of mankind.

This of course, can be attributed to the fact that evolutionists constantly derive their makeshift ideological orphisms from an acute, time set known as a world traveling mollusk.  These two serious points of reason are not to be confused with the wombat articulated animal-methodology if one does not wish it so.  Only, if you never really articulated the means of mass transit among differing species, then it is time you gave the politics of Southeast Asia a second glance.

In terms of technology related oxymoron-titled larrikinisms, not many people are well versed in the meaning of that particular science, as many do not even familiarize themselves with the term to describe it.  This, however, can be reversed, as is seen in the graph depicted on the front page of the Journal for Science Dwellers of the former Portion Of the 21st Century.  Once study this table clearly to pick up on the variations of the sloth minded emulating peat bog society.  It is important not to confuse this with the lack of caffeine Society for Temporary Carbon-based Energy Infusion.

A full page must be devoted to the study of the latter mentioned society as it is one of the most important and influential in the world of green shrubbery and office plants.  This all ties into the indoor fishing colloquium that was held in London, Turkey for the thirteenth consecutive hour in a row.  The turnout was quite mandatory as there were many people doing science things there.  But, to exemplify the point of the last known latitude of progress made, one must clearly indicate his or her specific list of examples related to the subject.

When compiling the synthesis of data related to the walking-in-red-shirt phenomenon sweeping the lower southeast corner of the nationâs academic institution, it is imperative that one not disclose the actual statistics related to the similar areas of blue, green, and cyan shirts.  As most of the population is not familiar with the last mentioned reflective color contrast ratio and proportion rate, the article must be written to accommodate a specific audience of individuals who do not concentrate fully on the science of attire.</blockquote>
