I was going to write a big, long, meaningful post about my graduation, but maybe I'll come up with something big, long, and meaningful about it later.  Suffice it to say that I graduated college on May 1, and sat there for several hours listening to 2,500 names be called, which was monotonous, but fun.

In any case, I took my first vacation that I've had for a while, went to the beach, went on a date or two :), saw the family, and slept a lot.

I got back to Tallahassee, and I've been exhausted ever since.  I've been working a lot, but apparently it's paid off.  Yesterday, the academic dean of my department approached me and asked me how I'd feel about starting graduate school on Monday.  I told him that would be great, but I didn't have $1,450.00 in my wallet at the time.  He laughed and said that the school would pay for it.

So, I'm a graduate student! <ahem> Excuse me, I'm a <b>G</b>raduate <strong>S</strong>tudent (on scholarship!).  So, I guess that graduation was simply a stepping stone in my educational goals.  The good news is that I get to be a graduate student on scholarship; the bad news is that I have to buy books and go to school on Monday.   Still, I'm not complaining!

Yesterday: College -- Today: Grad School -- Tomorrow: Ph.D.

In all, I am truly grateful for the opportunities that I have been given.  I won't let you all down.
