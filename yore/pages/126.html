Here in Tallahassee, we really loves us some football.  As Tallahassee as so often been cited, we are a drinking town with a football problem.  It's pretty true, actually.  The Wall Street Journal (I think) once indicated that we have over 130 places to buy booze within a mile of campus*.  That's a pretty party-hearty atmosphere.  In fact, I almost ran over a drunk guy the other night -- again.  But, I am digressing.

What I wish to talk about is our other revered and idolized activity here in Tally, which is, of course: watching football.  We love football.  We really love football.  This infatuation with sport is pretty appropriate in that it often goes hand-in-hand with drinking, i.e. you can both watch football and consume lots of booze concurrently without any major difficulties; our culture even promotes it.

But, about football specifically... Tallahassee IS football.  We have just built a new multi-million football training complex, put up two new statues around campus in the honor of football, and, of course, we have created a god.  Bobby "Yep, That's Me" Bowden is The <u>Man</u> here in Tallahassee.  One of those football statues that recently went up is a cast of him; you can see him endorsing many products on local television commercials (Bowden's Steam Cleaning; Proctor Honda; Subway, etc.); FSU just completed erecting the largest stained-glass window in the country, which is, of course, a picture of Bobby Bowden, etc.  His face adorns the wall of every local hangout, several billboards around town, t-shirts, and other countless facets of Tallahassee society.  You can even purchase an official Nike "Bowden" Seminoles hat.

He is the man.  Sometimes I believe that I am the only one who refrains from openly worshiping him around here.  I don't really see why we put so much stock in football around here, anyhow.  True, we have a really good team, and I know they put a lot of work in to win, but there are some people who live-and-die off of football.  I have friends who won't speak for days after we lose a game.  It's a little frightening.

This is why, when I heard that Bobby<sup>(tm - most likely)</sup> was coming here to my department to deliver a lecture on leadership, I was enthused about the celebrity appearance, but not ready to offer my kidneys to him as tokens of sacrificial appreciation.  I think I made the comment, "Isn't he going to croak soon?" the other night, and I swear my coworkers were about ready to shoot blow-darts at me.

What?!  He <em>is</em> pretty old...

In any case, my job with this whole lecture thing was to make sure that we got a good webcast of his talk this morning, which I am sorry to say that I got a mediocre recording of it, but it is still decent enough to know that the blob on the screeen is probably him, or at least somebody remotely related to him.  This morning, I set up the webcasting equipment, turned it all on, and waited for Bobby<sup>(tm)</sup> to show up.  He did, and so did a barrage of people to watch him.  I swear, LIS4930 has not had an attendance rate so high in the entire history of the class.  At first, there were really no surprises from Bobby; he is indeed shorter in person, not quite as horizontally large as he is on television, and quite amiable.  I had the privlage of speaking with him personally, actually.  My conversation with him went as follows:

<strong>Me:</strong> Hi, Mr. Bowden <em>[I should have called him "Coach"]</em>. Do you mind if I put this lavalier on you?  We're doing a webcast.

<strong>Bowden:</strong> Nope.  Here, I'll put it on myself.

<strong>Me:</strong> Thanks!

See, I know how to hob-nob with the celebrities these days.  We were practically swapping stories about old girlfriends.  I think I'll invite him over for beer (oh, the hypocracy!)

Again, I am digressing.  I would like to get to the point of this post, which is: Bobby Bowden is actually a very impressive guy.  His speech on leadership was incredibly interesting, very inspiring, straight to the point, and, because of his strong southern mannerisms, quite entertaining.  So, in short, after hearing the man talk, I can understand why we like Bobby<sup>(tm)</sup> so much around here.  He is such a nice guy (even stayed around to sign autographs for a while), that I can understand why Tallahassee people think that Steve Spurrier was the AntiChrist<sup>(tm)</sup>.  I hope Bobby and his crew of football dudes crushes the Gators next year, just to spite the legacy of Coach Spurrier.

It just goes to show you that my qualm about our football obsession isn't with The Big B, but with the occasional football-idiot who is obsessed beyond all reason with the sport.  Bowden sees football as is job and passion; he gets the job done as best as possible and understands that the publicity is all latent compared to the real goal: being the best as he possibly can at what he does.

But, enough from me; you can hear it straight from the source.  That is, if you can put up with some of my static problems.  The first four minutes of the following video are filled with a lot of really loud static, but if you can get past that, then I feel that you will enjoy this (really, really low-tech) Realmedia file:
