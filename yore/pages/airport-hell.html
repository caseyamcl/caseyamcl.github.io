It's where I end up every time I travel.

Wait, I guess I should back up a bit: I am very sorry for the delay in posting.  I've been a bad blogger lately, but you'd understand if you knew where I was.  Well, actually, you can probably guess.  I am thinking of renaming this webpage, "Casey's Airport Adventures".

Right now, I am in the middle of yet another one.  Some of you may remember the fiasco trying to get back from Colorado Springs, and more recently, mine and my brother's mega-disaster in Spain.  Today, I am super lucky, because I get to be in Texas at the George Bush International Center-of-the-Universe-Don't-Mess-With-Texas Airport.  I had a lot of trouble getting here, but I am having even more trying to get out of here.

It's funny how, when you get on an airplane, you really don't know where you're going to end up.. Washington DC on the street... Paris, France by accident... Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Miami... and yet my plane ticket never tells me where the airline is going to send me on a surprise bonus-trip.  This time, the airlines have indirectly contributed to my having to drive through Iowa with my sister, which was not planned.  More on that some other time...

But, I really don't want to publish all the boring details in prose form, so for the record, I will state briefly the following facts of my current adventure:

I have...

(a) Spent 4 hours waiting in Tallahassee for the plane to leave,
(b) Spent 2 1/2 hours in the air being rerouted from Florida to Houston through <em>Corpus Christie</em>... yeah...
(c) Sat in the plane on the tarmac for 1 1/2 hours at Houston waiting for a gate,
(d) Sat in the gate for two hours waiting for my flight to be canceled,
(e) Waited in line for three hours at the ticket counter trying to get a replacement flight (sound familiar, Jake?  ...only this time, everybody stood in an actual line...)
(f) Now, I'm waiting until nine this morning to see if I can get on another flight, and if not then, I'll be heading out of here at three this afternoon!  ...sigh...

Boy is flying fun....  But, I do not want to anger the airport.. it's all around me.. I think it can hear me.. In fact, I <em>love</em> the airport.  I think the airport is just swell.  Golly gee whiz, I wish I could spend all day here.  (Oh... wait.)

But.. if this all works out, it'll all be worth it, because I'm on my way to Chicago again!  This time, I have to earn my way there, apparently, through an exhausting, hunger-laden, back aching right of passage.  There will be many a indulgence in R&R once I get there, because this is the second (no wait--third) most difficult vacation I have been on lately.

Working for it is half the fun.  Now, I'm going to go to sleep on that bench over there before I become even more delusional.  Cheers!

p.s. I promise to be a better blogger in the near future.
