Tonight, I broke my distance record and did six miles!  I couldn't believe how much energy I had.  I figured by the time I got to lap 20, I would be sprawled on the ground pulling myself forward with my arms.  This wasn't the case.  Having decided to sprint the last quarter mile, I rounded lap 24 at break-neck speed.

I have to say that running with Keri is much, much better than running alone.  She's a motivator and a half.  So, our goal for next week is seven miles.  This Wednesday we're going to do the steps at the Florida Capitol Building, which will be challenging, but should be a lot of fun.

Why didn't I start doing this sooner?
