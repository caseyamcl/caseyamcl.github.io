I never used to believe in ghosts or the paranormal.  "That's all a load of crap," I would say, mockingly, and then proceed to dictate exactly why I thought it was a load of crap.  I would be on my soap box talking for days, sometimes months at a time about why I thought that anybody who had any belief in "ghosts" and such was just typically loopy, much like those people who claim that Elvis bought them breakfast at a diner in Reno.

Then I got a job in a haunted house.

I work in a law firm in a remodeled nineteenth century circa plantation house, complete with slave quarters out back.  If that's not enough, it was also an abortion clinic several decades ago.  These days, it's usually swarming with attorney-types who need a lot of clerical and computer work performed by assistants so they can spend more time golfing and hunting rabbits and such.  That's why I work there. Lately, though, work has been piling up so much, that I've had to go in there on Wednesday nights to get work done... by myself... in this old plantation house ... where floors creak ... the house settles ... and strange stuff happens.

Needless to say, with me sitting at my desk on the second floor, all alone in the middle of the night with only about two lights on in the entire building, freaky stuff happens.  The first incident happened about a week and a half ago when the cleaning guy came in.  No, the cleaning guy is not a ghost, but he does come in on Wednesday nights to do whatever it is that he does.  He came up and started talking to me for a few minutes, and then he proceeded to do his job.  A few minutes later, he comes by my desk again, and felt the compulsion to nonchalantly inquire, "Hey, Casey, what happened to that other person that was just up here?  Did he leave?"

"<em>What</em> other person, John?"

"The guy I was just talking to."

"<em>What</em> guy, John?"

"The guy that just walked by a few minutes ago."

"I've been here alone all night, John.  Nobody's come in besides you."

"I just talked to another guy up here in that room over there." (Points to a dark room with all of the lights off)

"Don't tell me that, John."

"Well, whatever happened to him, I dunno."

The second incident happened a week later, two nights ago on Wednesday.  Once again, it was dark, but this time there was a full moon surrounded by ghastly looking clouds that was framed beautifully in that back upstairs windows.  It looked looked like a camera shot from "The Shining".  Once again, John came in that evening, but did his job quickly and left promptly, because he felt kind of "weird" about being there that night.  Then, I was left alone.  Alone, in the dark, in a century-old house where they used to kill living things, in October, during a full moon.  I decided, considering the circumstances, that I'd spend about three or four more minutes there, and then depart as soon as humanly possible for the sake of my sanity, if nothing else.

Then, breaking the silence of an empty building, I heard a voice.

It was a loud, raspy, woman's voice, and although I couldn't make out exactly what it said, it was clear as day.  Knowing that there was absolutely no one else there, I promptly dropped whatever it was in my hand and did the real brave thing -- I froze up stiff.  After I pooled my wits, I checked the building.  There was nobody downstairs, nobody out back, and nobody in the foyer.  Nobody was in the other attorney's offices, and the doors were locked tight throughout the office.  But, I definitely heard the voice.  I didn't hear anything else after that, but of course, I was out of the building faster than lightning.

Finally, the third incident happened this morning, during the day, which absolutely proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the house is possessed.  That incident was that my boss was actually in a good mood.  I know it's Friday and he's going on vacation soon, but he was genuinely happy.  Something is definitely wrong with that place.

Of course, every night I'm there alone, I always hear the house settle, and there's also the random noises.  Those include, but are not limited to, loud creaking, subtle banging noises, clicking, and very soft 'wooing that I've always assumed was caused by the wind.  I'm beginning to think otherwise.

My sister and I go to Chicago every fall to scout out haunted places in the big city, but we've never found any.  This year, I'll be a little bit less skeptical of the possibility.  Of course, I apparently don't even have to leave my own home to experience some of the most nerve-bending paranormal activity I've ever been around.

I'm actually kind of looking forward to next Wednesday night.
