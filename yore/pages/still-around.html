Howdy!  This post is coming to you from my new apartment.  I have not even been here for 24 hours, and I have already found somebody's unsecure wireless network connection to bum off of.  Can we say <b>192.168.1.1</b>?  I could kiss those people at Linksys for shipping <em>every single unit</em> with <em>the same</em> default settings.  I even logged into the router as administrator.  Apparently, there are <b>12</b> other people also using this particular router, even though all the apartments in this complex are one-bedroom units.  Maybe I will kick them all off to get higher bandwidth.

I have not posted in a while, because, (a) I have been out of the state, (b) I have come back and immediately began moving, (c) I have a job, and (d) can we say "par-tay"? I do, however, promise soon (I know you're waiting, Lisa!) some cool material from the trip across the country.

In the meantime, take it easy.
