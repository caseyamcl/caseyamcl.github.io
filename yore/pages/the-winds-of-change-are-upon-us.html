Like this blog.  It has now, in my humble opinion, changed for the better.  Not all change is good, though.  Some change is good; some is bad.  For instance, way back in the elementary school cafeteria, when they changed the menu to include the option of pizza every day, that was a good change.  However, when they stopped using real forks and switched to using those "spork" things, that was definitely bad.  They severely limited the ability to use the utensil as a food catapult in that, while the spoonish shape increased the capacity of the object, the shorter length limited the torque and leverage to the point that it rendered the potential weapon harmless.  And lets not forget about that short period of time when the powers that be decided to eliminate the use of milk cartons and imlement those little "milk baggies".  Talk about a black spot on the slate of the history of changes made in this universe.  It took them about a week to discover that the idea was not so good after all in that it encouraged young future citizens such as myself to use the elasticity of the "milk baggie" container to serve as a pressurized liquid launching mechanism.  In other words, much like the majority of my peers, I squirted the milk - alot - until the rulers of the cafeteria decided to go back to using cartons and stop the milk wars, which was a good change.

Eventually, much like the rest of the world (except in Georgia, perhaps), I graduated from the ranks of Elementary school and change wasn't so clear cut between good and evil anymore.  In fact, sometimes it's difficult to tell what outcome certain changes will have on life in general.  Nevertheless, as R.L. Stevenson put it, the only thing constant is change.  So now I sit here for the first time in my life not knowing exactly where I will be in eight months from now.  For the past sixteen years, I have come to pretty much expect that by the upcoming August, I would be sitting in a room somewhere listening to some instructor drone on about something or another with the U.S. Government willingly providing me with monetery compensation to do so.  Now, come August, I don't know if I'll be listening to a professor drone on about informatics processing, to a boss drone on about TPS reports, or people that walk by me on the street drone on about how homeless people such as my potential self should get a job and quit begging for change (the monetary kind).

But, anyhow, I'm about out of time.  I have to change my rain-soaked shirt, grab some spare change from my drawer, change gears for class, and go put on a short presentation about how technology has changed the 20th century, which is known by some as "The Century of Change"; however, that view is changing as more events that change our world are unfolding in this new millennium.

Alright; enough of that.
