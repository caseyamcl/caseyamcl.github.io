Where have I been?  Well, actually, I have been back in town, but I have not really been back in town.  Well, I have, but it has been a ridiculously frantic week and a half.  I have not even had time to make fun of people by rearranging the letters in their names.  I do not even have time to post to this blog, which I should not be doing right now.  Hey, but what are you going to do -- try to stop me?

The reason, of course, for all the craziness I have endured over the past several days, is that I decided to go on vacation at the most inopportune week of the year, which is, quite honestly, every week.  However, nothing was going to stop me, and nothing did.  Not school, not extracurricular meetings, not my over-so-sensible friends, and definitely not work.  So, against ALL of the odds and in the face of colossal reason and logic, I got on a plane in Tallahassee on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 22, 2003, and ended up at the Congress Plaza Hotel that very evening (I transported myself there via bodily decompositional/recompositional transport -- forget the planes).

And now, I"m sure all three of you faithful readers out there are dying to know exactly about all of the exciting things that occurred while I was in a foreign location.  That is, namely, "Did you do anything stupid while I was there, Casey, and can you please tell the story in a wildly embarrassing and self-detrimental way?" I respond to that by saying, "Certainly, Although, things didn't get that out-of-hand this year, in part because the groundskeepers at Resurrection Cemetery lock the gates at night to discourage people such as myself from wandering the gravesites aimlessly at night.  Still, however, we did ride by the cemetery twice, and once I even got out and met a crazy lady outside the gates.  She was not dead, but she was certainly loopy enough to drive only partially insane people such as myself away.

If you have absolutely no idea what I am talking about, do not distress.  I will explain... maybe (pending the time available).  In a nutshell, Chicago is full of all kinds of crazy stuff, and the fun doesn't end there, which is why Lisa and I decided to rent a car and visit Wisconsin for no apparent reason whatsoever.  But, I am getting out of order here.

Okay, so it was Wednesday night, and I arrived in Chicago on a stormy, cold, bitter, nineteenth century night.  Wait, scratch that.  It was actually pretty clear, not too cold, somewhat pleasant, and in fact, 2003.  In fact, the trip from Midway Airport to the Congress Plaza Hotel was fairly uneventful except for the fact that I was asked to provide "any spare change" to several arbitrary individuals along the way.  Ahh, Chicago.
Lisa arrived at the hotel approximately four hours after I did, allowing me to become very acquainted with the interior of the Hotel lobby and the Hotel bar.  I also learned, from the bartender at the lounge, that the Yankees are the worst team in the history of baseball with the exception of the Marlins, and that it would be really great if, somehow, both teams managed to lose the World Series.  Unfortunately for my circumstantial friend, one of the won.  As you can tell, in addition to leisure, it was a very educational trip.

Speaking of education, the first thing that Lisa and I did (after ordering Italian food at two in the morning) was visit the University of Illinois at Chicago.  I immediately noticed that I was no longer at FSU by observing the lack of empty beverage containers strewn around campus.  They don't even have their own Official Steaming Pile of Garbage (tm owned by FSU) or their own Permanent Dormant Construction Site.  I picked up some graduate applications and what-not, and decided, after about 3 ½ minutes of being there, that I had enough of school, so we went instead to a restaurant where the waitresses yell at you and dance on tables.
Ed-debevics is the name of the joint, and the entire theme is based upon the fact that people who work in 50's-Themed Diners generally hate their job, hate the customers, and especially hate dancing on tables.  They are trained to be rude, and the food is mediocre (except for the Chili), so of course we had to go, and we are probably going back next year.  You know you are eating at an honest place when the wait staff insists that you're "taking too long to order" and that she'd rather be doing <i>anything</i> else than waiting on you right now.  So true.

Later, we went to a comedy club, but before arriving there, we managed to get some foreign tourists from Asia lost.  Actually, Lisa managed to get some foreign tourists from Asia lost, and I was merely an accessory.  Ha ha.  Just because we SAY we know where we're going doesn't mean that we actually KNOW where we are going.

Anyhow, we also went to some shows, bought some stuff, went to Wisconsin, got hit on by old ladies (well, me at least), visited some museums, did this, that and the other thing, visited a possessed fountain, AND rode the train a lot.  Blah, blah, yadda, yadda, woof, woof.

More on all of that later, for now I have to run...
