Going through my notes from last week, I have come to realize that the possible reason for us getting lost so many times. Before the trip, we went surfed to <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> and had the computer generate directions from Tallahassee, Florida to 1900 W Buena Vista Drive, Orlando.

Here is the extremely helpful map of how to get to the Wyndham Resort that the computer came up with:

Thank you, computer!Â  I have no idea what we would do without technology.
