Greetings from the EduCAUSE conference!  Why?  (Edu)CAUSE we want to stay in an expensive hotel and get our tax-payer-based institutions to finance this mini-vacation while we spend three workdays sipping thirteen-dollar martinis at the hotel bar.

It's called a conference.  There is a lot of schmoozing, lecturing, martini drinking, and other similar activities that go on here.  The crowd here is more of your older, more sterile type (if I may).

This year, the good University that I work for has elected to put us up in the conference hotel which is really swank.  Every bellhop, receptionist, house cleaner, bartender, and janitor that works here smiles and says hello when I encounter them.  They seem generally happy to see me; this is weird, and a little disconcerting, because I know almost for a fact that they most certainly <em>aren't</em> most happy to see me at all.  In fact, they're probably pretty sick of dealing with snooty business dudes with big egos and gneeric personalities who throw $20 bills around like used-Kleenexes and demand constant levels of service and attention that would have made Rockefeller uncomfortable.

I've digressed a bit...... but, while I'm digressing, have you ever really thought about elevators?  I, for one, always get a little nervous when getting into an elevator in a tall building.  At the law firm I used to work at, the attorneys litigated several cases involving elevator failures and subsequent injuries.  There were cases where elevators fell three or four floors and permanently injured the riders.  It's a matter of absolute faith to step into a product of man-made engineering (it was man who invented the Hindenberg, the , and Space Shuttle Columbia - we are indeed fallible) and let it drop you 22 floors at a (hopefully) controlled rate.

Anyhow.. Nothing else much going on here, except for the conference, which I really should go attend sooner or later.  So, that's all for now.
