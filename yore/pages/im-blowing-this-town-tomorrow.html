It is, once again, October.  Of course, everybody knows what that means.  That means that I am going to dodge all responsibility, stop doing useful, productive things, and promptly leave town.  Chicago or Bust!

This will be the third pilgrimage that my sister and I have made in October to the Windy City.  They call it that, because the wind coming off the lake is cold enough to freeze the snot that comes out of your nose before it hits the ground, forming snot-stalactites that people from all over the world go to gawk at.  No, actually, they call it that, because way back in the day, a bunch of corrupt rich snobs blew through there all the time, but I'm not going there to see that.  I don't' even have to leave home to see rich snobs; I work in a law office.

No, no.  I am going to Chicago, because it provides me with a perfect excuse to take a vacation at the most unreasonable of times.  First of all, my sister Lisa and I are probably the only two schmucks that actually go <em>north</em> when it gets cold.  Everybody else crams into Florida for six months like squirrels hibernating (do squirrels hibernate?).   Then, of course, there's the fact that I am supposed to be in school right now.  That is, instead of going to class, I will be flying north.  Sounds like fun.  Thirdly, I am in college and am supposed to be poor.  This is true, but I intend to prove that it is possible to be poor <em>and</em> sit in a restaurant where waiters serve you ridiculously high-priced meat off of silver trays at the same time.

Of course, there are always certain risks that go along with taking a trip like this one.  One of those risks involves the possibility of going crazy, insane, or whatever they call it in the DSM.  Regardless, two years ago, my sister went completely bananas, as is documented in this photograph that I managed to snap:

...and she's a space systems engineer!

I, of course, spent the first day being a tourist, but became completely bored with the entire charade, so while my sister was recovering at the Chicago Wellness and Recovery Psychological Ward, I went off to found and manage a successful Fortune 500 Company for a week.  Here is a photograph of me attending the International World Affairs Summit downtown:

I gave the endeavor up, though, when I had to go back to class the following Monday.

This year ought to be really cool, but, now that I am becoming a seasoned Chicago-tourist, I am beginning to amount a massive number of responsibilities.  This year, I'm obligated to eat at a restaurant where they insult you, bring home chili-flavored popcorn for Helen, obtain one of those black "Second City" mugs, don a suit and visit a snooty piano bar, and attempt to encounter several ghosts.

Oh, what ever shall I do?
