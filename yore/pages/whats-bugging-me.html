Today I actually got home before seven o'clock at night, which means instead of working on homework somewhere else, I decided to sit down and read my Quan. Anal. book and make some steak.  After about a half hour of motionless, mind-enhancing (or nullifying, depending on your perspective) reading, I became aware of a companion sitting on my shoulder.  The little fella was apparently on a mission to the summit of my body and was halfway to my neck when I discovered him.
My initial reaction reflected that of thoughtful consideration for life forms of all kinds in that I flung him off my shoulder at near-warp speed and then proceeded to chase him around the living room with an oversized can of RAID spraying, for the most part, everything but the roach.  Finally, I brought an end to the chase when I blasted him with some trademarked poisen.  I'm pretty sure he had a broken leg from the fall anyways; I just wanted to put him out of his misery.  Now he is dying in peace in the middle of the living room.
My concern is where did he come from?  Roaches are one of my biggest weenie factors, and although my apartment isn't a shining example of cleanliness and order, I do try to make it as unnatractive for bugs as possible.  My primary theory on the matter is that the bug must have found his way over from the apartment next door.  Over there, on the other side of the paperthin walls (which also serve as an amplifcation device for the sex noises that are generated on the other side at 3 in the morning), they pretty much run a roach breeding farm, which is the latent result of the fact that the apartment is made up mostly of mold.

In any case, instead of studying for the next hour, I spent the time with a rag and a bottle of cleaner turning my apartment into an advertising campaign for Lysol.

To all other bugs out there who even think about crawling on me:  I am willing to go to unintelligable, impractical, unreasonable, and even inhuman extremes to eliminate you.  Just consider it a case-in-point that my living room floor is now 8% carpet and 92% Raid.

Victory at any cost.
