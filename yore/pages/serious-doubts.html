I discovered this site the other day: <a href="http://www.20q.net">20q</a>.  It greatly disturbs me.

20q.net is a site where you can basically play the ever-popular game, 20 questions, against a giant neural network software program engineered by some guy who lives in his parent's basement and hasn't seen the sun for decades.  What disturbs me about this site isn't the fact that the computer plays the game rather well, it's that the computer plays the game better than I do!

For example, I remember my friend and I used to play this game in the car on the way between Orlando and Tallahassee.  She managed to stump me with "ketchup packet".  I had guessed everything from dog to Czechoslovakia over about three hours (that's at least 180 questions).  She told me I was stupid.  I didn't believe it at the time, but after the computer guessed it correctly in 20, I am beginning to seriously question my deductive reasoning ability.
