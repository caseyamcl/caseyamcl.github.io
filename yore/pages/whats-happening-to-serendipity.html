So, I have two e-mail accounts.  One is my primary address, and the other one I set up on Yahoo to direct all the spam to.  When I was checking the latter today, I noticed an advertisement stating that a certain particular company could find you the love of your life, guaranteed.  I thought, "Well, that is a pretty hefty claim.  Let's see what they have to say."  After all, who knew that finding the love of your life was as easy as buying wheat germ at Save-A-Lot?

According to their website, you follow a six-step routine:  First, you, the desperate and lonely soul, take a personality test consisting of no less than 500 questions, which in my opinion, is more of a pain than the GRE.  It's supposed to find your "29 dimensions that scientific research has shown are crucial to long-term relationships".  Then you shell out a lot of money.  Then, after you read your expert computer-generated psychology report, you let a super computer (made from cheez whiz cans and spare bicycle parts) eliminate all of the people who are not scientifically and objectively compatible with your personality (who needs 'em anyways).  The company's ad states, "With <blank company> doing all the work [for a fee], you get to relax and concentrate on the chemistry of falling in love [with your new mate hand picked with all of the loving care of a systematic algorithm written in C++ by some geek who plays minesweeper a lot and hasn't seen the sun for at least a week]".  You then select an individual from the computer's hand-picked list, supposedly really like each other (assuming somebody didn't misplace a decimal point or divide by 0 while writing the computer program), get married, and live out the rest of your life bliss, all thanks to that $40 you shelled out so that you wouldn't have to meet somebody (gasp) in person.  It's true love.

There are many of these sites on the Internet, and I'm sure that everybody reading this has come across one once or twice.  There are some where you get to rate people on how they look -- this, of course, is addicting as ever, but it does kind of hint at the shallow beast within us all.  Of course, you can also choose to meet the people you rate (for a fee).  "Hey, I rated you a 2 out of 10, wanna meet up?"  Then there are ones for people looking only to find somebody to copulate with.  Then there are ones for teen-agers, ones for Christians, ones for senior citizens, ones for college students, ones for rednecks, etc.

So, finally getting to the point, I ask the question, what happens if one of these programs is flawed.  I mean what if the geek who programmed it accidentally misplaced a decimal point, forgot a semicolon, or divided by 0 or something?  Would the program accidentally try to pair you up with people that you absolutely can't stand?  I can see the headlines, now:
<blockquote>Butcher stabbed to death by Vegan on Date Gone Wrong</blockquote>
I can just imagine the pseudo-computer code that the people who write the programs use while developing the system:
<blockquote>IF personA-personality EQUALS personB-personality AND personA-gender NOT EQUALS personB-gender THEN:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATCH personA TO personB;
ELSE:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT MATCH personA TO personB;
ENDIF</blockquote>
Now imagine if the programmer gets bored one night and starts nodding off or gets distracted during the writing of that oh-so crucial single line of code and accidentally misplaces the "NOT" clause.  Just one word in the entire program out of thousands... No big deal, right?  Hmm:
<blockquote>IF personA-personality NOT EQUALS personB-personality AND personA-gender EQUALS personB-gender THEN:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATCH personA TO personB;
ELSE:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT MATCH personA TO personB;
ENDIF</blockquote>
Oops.. That might not go over so well.

In any case, my theory is that you probably have a better chance of meeting that "special certain someone" at the laundromat than by paying some Internet company to do it for you.  So, to all of you people shelling out their credit card numbers to these companies, STOP!  YOU CAN DO IT FOR FREE!

I just hope that Microsoft doesn't get into the act.  We're liable to see the collapse of society as we know it.
