Helen told me that I have to publish a link to some of my webpages that I've developed for school.  So, without further ado, here they are:

**DISCLAIMER:  I have no control over the University servers, so if you're reading this in 2042 and expect for these links to work, but they don't because the computers where these websites reside on are somewhere at the bottom of a landfill, because the school decided to get rid of them, don't come crying to me.**

My Course Website for LIS4366:  <a href="http://slis-seventeen.lis.fsu.edu/~U366-77/">http://slis-seventeen.lis.fsu.edu/~U366-77</a>

This is my course website for LIS4366.  There is not much on it now, but I will be required to publish all of my work for that class there.  It's a pretty simple use of CSS/HTML.  No scripting was involved.

Subs.com! for Another Class:
<a href="http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~cam02h/subsCom.html">http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~cam02h/subsCom.html</a>

This page does absolutely nothing, but if it did, the world would be a much better place.

TravelWeb.com! for Another Class:
<a href="http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~cam02h/travlWeb.html">http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~cam02h/travlWeb.html</a>

We had to use articles given to us by our instructor for this webpage.  I would have much rather put my own, more interesting articles on this facade page, like, "President of LuxAir Constapation Problem Increasing", or "Yosemite Park Limits Access--Nobody Cares".

Enjoy my totally useless websites.  That's all for now; will blog later!
