Hello remaining website readers,

My apologies for not getting anything up here lately. That seems to be a theme with this website. I think I need to hire somebody to do my work for me so I can concentrate doing more important things, like fishing, lounging around, and updating this website.

So, in case anybody cares to know, here are the things I have been doing instead of writing content:
<h2>Traveling Around North Florida</h2>
On Saturday night, three friends of mine, Danielle, Brian, and Anna decided that we needed to get a slurpee from Seven Eleven. This was all good and well, except for the fact that the nearest Seven Eleven is approximately 200 miles from Tallahassee. Fortunately, this minor challenge didn't deter us.

We left Tallahassee at 10:30 p.m. on Saturday night and arrived in Lake City for our first stop at around midnight, where we picked up a bluegrass CD to annoy Anna with.

Then we drove straight to Jacksonville and found this raunchy 50's dance club, which wouldn't let us in. Brian also climbed on top of a Checkers Restaurant.

Then we went to the beach for a few minutes.  This was around 2:00 a.m.

After that, we stopped in St. Augustine, since we hadn't been there in a few years. It's a bit different at 2:00 in the morning, but it was still fun. We trespassed in the fort (Castillo de san Marco) and then visited Flagler College.

Then we found it: <strong>SEVEN ELEVEN</strong> - We got slurpees and took a picture with Wally, the friendly counter manager at around 3:00 in the morning. This happened to be, as Wally explained, the northernmost Seven Eleven in the state of Florida, which is almost exactly 240 miles from Tallahassee. I wouldn't exactly call it a <em>"convenience store"</em>.

<strong>AT THIS POINT...</strong> we weren't about to turn around. We headed south to Daytona Beach and then east to Deland where we stopped at another Seven Eleven and raided Stetson University.

Then we  went to my parent's house at 4:30 in the morning and left a travel gift for them along with a (most likely) confusing note explaining my presence.

Then we went to Brian's family's house and woke up his brother.

Then we went to Anna's parent's house in Ocala and took a 5 minute nap.

Then we went to IHOP in Lake City and got breakfast, and it was finally back to Tallahassee by 9:30 on Sunday morning.

Overall, we traversed 550 miles in 11 hours.  What a night.. Pictures to come soon.
<h2>Working on Web Design</h2>
I have been learning a thing or two about good design and CSS. The only problem I seem to be having is with aesthetics and color combinations. Here is the test design site I have been developing to replace this one:

<a href="http://devca.net/develop/CaseyMclaughlin.com/blog/tester.php">http://devca.net/develop/CaseyMclaughlin.com/blog/tester.php</a>

It's ADA compliant, xHTML certified, CSS2 certified, and works a lot better, too.

Let me know what you think!
<h2>Moving</h2>
I have thusly decided to leave my television-loving roommate behind and move out on my own. The main reason wasn't Jason, even though his loafing has started to become frighteningly addictive (we spent 3 1/2 hours watching "Stargate SG-1" nonstop the other night). Nope, the biggest reason was the sometimes 20 minute commute that I have to make even though I live <em>less than two miles from work</em>.  Seriously.

So, my big selling point on finding a new place was location. The good news is, I actually found a new place to live that is so close to work, it is actually less distance away from my building than where I have to currently park when I drive to campus.

Here, take a look at this and see for yourself: <a href="http://www.devca.net/blog/images/04-29-2005-MapToSchool.jpg">Look at my Map</a>

See?

So, I'll be living solo for at least a year.  If you come visit me, I'll make you one of the best cappacinos on this side of Tallahassee.
<h2>Finally, Work</h2>
Ahh, both the purpose and bane of my existence for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. This week has be extra interesting in that I got to deliver my very first speech in front of the entire faculty on Wednesday, which was one of the more interesting experiences of my career.

I spent about 25 minutes explaining a new calendar system that I am in charge of making sure gets implemented to replace the current one. I talked to them about how great it is, how compatible the calendar is with other applications, how it is faster, sleeker, newer than the system we have now, which was developed around the same time that the wheel was. After this elaborate description I delivered, one of the more outspoken faculty members explained, in a flurry of vivid adjectives, how his daily planner is much more useful than any *bleep*-ing durfangled computer program I can give him. This, of course, opened up the floor for all kinds of abuses to thrown in my direction, which eventually led to my asking the question of how many faculty members actually <em>use</em> the current calendar system, anyways.

One person raised her hand.

It's been that kind of week.

While on the subject of work, I would like to mention that me and my team have had an outstanding semester, and I am sorry to be losing some of my favorite interns and graduate assistants, Fred and Eugene. Hope you guys do well. I know that Eugene is headed for a career in Government Information Intelligence, and Fred is on his way to graduate school in Education Systems Development. I'd also like to welcome on board our new interns, Joshua, Sandy, and Stuart, who will be taking up the slack.
