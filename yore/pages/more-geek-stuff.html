title: 'More Geek Stuff'

Working in a technology department is never a walk in the park.  Anybody will tell you that.  If you get the job, it pretty much means that, somewhere along the road, you picked up skills that other people neglected to learn for whatever reason.  Plus, you deal with computers, which are pre-programmed to break.  Sometimes, when I give somebody a computer, I want to say: "Here is your computer; it <em>will definitely</em> break, and probably pretty soon.  So, whatever you do -- DON'T ATTEMPT TO FIX IT YOURSELF."

It's a common thing to get a call from a user complaining that there is a Cheezit stuck between his 'G' key and his 'H' key, tell him not to touch anything and that we'll be right down, and arrive two minutes later to find every component that is supposed to be inside the computer spread out all over the floor with a spork stuck in the power supply.  "I thought I would try to fix it before you came down."  If you are a user, <strong><u>NEVER DO THIS</u></strong>.  General rule of thumb: <strong><u> Wait for the Geek to Come</u></strong>; he has no life and has spent many Friday nights learning how to fix your problem.

So, anyhow, needless to say, we get a lot of people coming through our door looking for help -- and nobody comes through the door of an IT shop because they're happy.  We used to say that in the law business, too.  Although, I'd sometimes rather have somebody come through the door who just lost three out of four limbs due to a strange accident at work and is aching to sue than somebody who deleted their POP3 account in Microsoft Outlook.  The former is often more amiable than the latter.

I have an equation about most computer users, which goes as follows:

<center><strong>1 / (Intelligence of User) = (Level of Anger)</strong></center>In other words, there is a negative correlation between the knowledge the user has about computers and how angry that person will be when he or she storms through the door of User Services.  Generally, we don't let these kind of people get to us anymore, because they often are more humorous than frightening (for the most part).  Sometimes you get an SU (Scary User), but generally it is good times for the IT staff.  So, in the spirit of good humor, I will share a few anecdotes from the past few months dealing with some of our friends out there in "non-computer" land:<strong>Shocking!</strong>
We had a lady come in quite a few months ago needing some help in getting her laptop setup on the wireless network in our department.  This complicated process involved: (1) turning her computer on, (2) double-clicking the Internet Explorer icon, (3) typing in her username and password.  Naturally, you can see, it was a long and tedious learning process.

Our client, however, was actually pretty forward thinking.  Hence her question about how she could protect her laptop against power surges in the air now that she was wireles.  We, as honestly as possible, explained to her that electrical surges from the air simply are to be expected, especially on a computer with a rotater splint with as many pistons as hers.  Then several of us pretended to get shocked from electrical surges floating around in the air.  "Bzzzzt -- OW!!"

We haven't seen our client since.

<strong>Shred This</strong>
One of our own esteemed collegues decided that she was going to shred some papers one day.  Shredders, indeed, are fun.  You get to destroy things with them.  However, the way people use them is often quite perplexing.  Consider this warning label on the shredder we have in our office:
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Tie in Shredder" id="image130" src="/yore/images/02-22-2005-shredder.jpg" /></div>
One must ask oneself:  Are people really this dense?  Apparently so.

Our friendly coworker doesn't generally fall into this category.  This person didn't put her tie into the shredder, but she must have been having a bad day or something, because she managed to cram more 8 1/2 x 11" papers into a .025 inch space than physics dictates is possible.  I believe there were upwards of 30 sheets in there.

"When some papers got jammed in there, I just kept putting more in the shredder trying to get them to go through," she claimed in denfense.  This theory, to the best of my knowledge, has never worked, ever, in the history of the universe.  We don't hold it against her, though; we just make fun of her for it nonstop these days.

Well, maybe Jeff holds it against her.  He spent three hours with a flathead screwdriver removing every atom of paper in the shredding unit.  How's that for putting your CCNA certification to work, buddy? HAR HAR.

<strong>Easy Does It</strong>
The most amusing problems that we have to solve always start with an encounter with the user wherein he or she states, "My computer is running slow."  This happens at least once a week, and it is always fun to go see what that person did.

One of the secretaries has this problem quite often, and it is still mildly amusing to see what she clicked "YES" to on the Internet this week.  It is, however getting to the point where we might considering locking down her computer to the point where we "turn off" the Internet and let her work in MS-DOS 5.1 instead.

This person had, one time, installed just about every free adware program that exists on the Internet.  The list included:
<ul>
	<li>Several horoscope software items ("today you will meet a stranger, and your computer will crash repeatedly"),</li>
	<li>At least two weather applications ("current CPU temperature: 800 degrees"),</li>
	<li>Bonzai Buddy (Ad campaign: "I will quickly destroy your computer while annoying you; Blitzkrieg!!") -- as a side note, Bonzai Buddy was created by Nazis in a more successful attempt than the first to take over the world--, and...</li>
	<li>My favorite, GAIM, formerly known as "Gator" ("Click here for absolutely no reason other than to install loads of lethal software onto your computer and bring it down - <strong>BRING IT DOWN!! MUWHAAHAHAHAHAHABUYxCAMHAHAHAHAH</strong>").</li>
</ul>
We should have left GAIM on for punishment, but as the boss says, productivity is important, and even the most click-happy users must have their computer running well.

Alas, people will continue to break their computers quite often, and it is only the geekiest of us; those who have no life and understand a lot about computers, that will be the ones who talk bad about "normal people" who think that when the computer says "Click Here", it means "Click Here".  Fortunately, I do have a life and do not fall into that category.

Of course, if you read my last post, you know I'm lying...
