Yes, I finally stopped mooching off of the girl down the hall who has an unsecure wireless router, and got my own Internet.  I'll be dutifully paying Comcast 40 of my hard-earned dollars each month for them to bring things like <a href="http://www2.b3ta.com/realistic-internet-simulator/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.stupid.com/index.html">this</a>, and of course, <a href="http://www.t45ol.com/play_us/1840/bird-and-elephant.html">this</a> into my apartment at six megabits per second.

What motivated me to do this?  Was it a higher moral cause to stop freeloading off of the American economy or taking advantage of some poor inept girl's lack of network security?  Was it because I thought that Comcast deserved my money for providing Internet service?  Was it because I wanted a shiny little box with blinking lights that says "Linksys" in my living room?

To these, I answer emphatically, "nein" (well, maybe a little bit yes for that last one).

It's because of the all-empowering Greek God of Internet: bandwidth.  It seems that I wasn't the only person in my apartment complex who decided that free Internet is a good thing.  There were 43 people connected to Poor Inept Girl's router.  I know, because I logged into the router as administrator and kicked some of them off every now and then when I felt like I wasn't getting enough bandwidth... I know: evil, but smart (which makes it okay).

In any case, I would have blocked most all of them permanently from connecting to her router, since I had now assumed administrative access and therefore administrative responsibility of her network.  There was, however, one underlying problem: I didn't know which computer was actually hers.  If I had blocked her computer, she would have surely called Comcast to find out what was going on, and perhaps spoken to a person with more than three braincells over there who would have enlightened her with network security wisdom, and I couldn't have that.

So, I competed for bandwidth with at least 40 other free-loaders who undoubtedly hogged as much bandwidth as they could get their grubby little hands on downloading reruns of "Seinfeld" and "Mystery Science Theater 3000".  As more people got on, it became difficult for <em>me</em> to download "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes, which is, of course, extremely important.

I called Comcast on Friday, and the guy came out today to help hook everything up.  And now... I'm contributing to that large sum of money that goes towards buying Mr. Comcast CEO a new convertible with a jacuzzi in the back (see below).  At least, however, I'm now doing one more moral thing in my life by not stealing the Internet, which brings me to being about 12.3% moral, which--let's face it--is a new record!

Plus I have a shiny box with blinky lights on it in my living room.
