Today was day two of the conference.  It was much less stressful, and the sessions are one hour long each, not eight hours long!  So, things have been okay.  Highlights include:
<ul>
	<li>Some guy next to me nearly had a heart attack when the speaker at the Yale seminar stated that he (the speaker) charges $90.00 an hour for support services.</li>
	<li>I spilled coffee all over myself.</li>
	<li>I raced into the restroom to clean it off - <em>the women's restroom</em> (by accident).  Then, I raced out of the women's restroom and into the men's room where I sat in a stall for 30 minutes trying to clean my shirt.</li>
	<li>One seriously supersonic speed round of putt-putt with my brother sister, and her significant other.</li>
	<li>A more-than-interesting time at TGI's with friends.</li>
	<li>I won two shirts at a vendor booth for correctly identifying what HTML is (they don't have high standards for knowledge here, I suppose)</li>
	<li>I ate an unidentifiable lunch, graciously provided by the conference people.</li>
</ul>
That's all the exciting news from Educause I have today.  As you can see, my presence here is definitely benefiting the college that sent me.

...and just for the record, in reference to a prior post, nobody I have come across has been inebriated, except some of the speakers.
