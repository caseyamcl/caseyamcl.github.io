I have been burdened with a virus lately.  Not a computer virus--a real one!  Yes, they do still exist.  This latest virus has caused my body to reject a lot of food and produce a lot of snot and flem.  There's a microbiological evolutionary joke for you: Why do we produce snot when we get sick?  Couldn't we find a more efficient and less annoying way of fighting illness?

Hypothetical Situation:

<b><i>Me:</b></i> "Hello."

<b><i>Pretty Girl met Serendipitously:</b></i> Hi.  Did you know you have a booger hanging from your nose?

As you can see, the situation has the potential to grow way out of hand very quickly.  I have thought about going to the doctor's office on campus.  But then I thought better of it.  I'd rather just die.  Anything is better than Thagard Health Center.

Even work, which is what I've been doing to get better (ignoring all logic and advice). With this illness and lots of work at my job, I have no life, and in the spirit of all of the sudden having no life, I will proceed to boldly bore you until your brain starts coming out of your right ear. Yes, work is a provocative subject, full of things like "synergy" and "dynamic convergence" and "meetings". I have a new boss now, and he is very much into "meetings". In fact, his solution to everything is, "schedule a meeting". After we were done meeting today, he actually told me to schedule a meeting to follow up on the meeting.

<i>[aside]Oh God, am I really writing about this?  <strong><em>What Happened to My Life?!</em></strong>  You know what the really sad part is?  I actually laughed at that last paragraph.  I thought it was <em>funny</em>!  I have become a corporate drone.[/aside]</i>

Ahem.. Anyhow, after my endless meetings with the same three people, I eventually go back to my desk and send e-mails out planning when and where and for how long the next meeting will be. After that, I see what meetings people have planned for me, and then I go to those.  Eventually, I just keel over and die from all of the meetings.

<i>[aside]____?!  That wasn't even close to funny... or provocative... or useful or enriching to your life in any way.  You benefited nothing by reading that.  I don't even know why I wrote it.  Actually, I do.  It's because work has sucked the  [/aside]</i>

Ahem.. The few times that I am not meeting, I sit in front of my computer and browse the Internet, trying to recover from all of the meetings.  Usually, I have to wait until 5 p.m. to get any paperwork done, because I am running around all day.  Haha.. isn't that funny?  I have to wait until <em>after</em> I am supposed to go home to do what we call "honest work"?  It was a joke.. sigh....

<i>[aside]I am a loser with no life and a receeding hairline who will spend the rest of his life married to his job. I was once cool. I once took serendiptious road trips for days at a time with interesting and (okay, mildly) mysterious women.  But, now.. now, look at me![/aside]</i>

Computers are not any less cumbersome than clients and colleagues.  They often come up with weird and stressful things to communicate to me at the most inopportune times.  Things like "license expired" and "Fatal error: 0x0000243 - I'm Dying".  I have posted many a post about how they are very difficult to deal with overall in terms of support.  But, alas, they are the primary tool in my career, so I will continue to support them.

<i>[aside]Are you really still reading this junk?! I mean, come on! I would have stopped reading at least thirty sentences ago! What is wrong with you?[/aside]</i>

Anyhow, it's back to the grindstone for me (har har.. get it? Grindstone -- it's a metaphor) <i>[aside]Shut up, Casey[/aside]</i>.  Catch you next time.
