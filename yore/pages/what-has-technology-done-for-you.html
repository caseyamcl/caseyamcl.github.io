What could possibly be better than talking to somebody from a mobile phone while you are driving (pending the fact that you don't lose concentration and accidentally go careening off of the side of the road, hit a tree, and get knocked into a lake filled with acidic nuclear waste runoff, where your automatic door locks freeze up and trap you inside the car to drown while you are nibbled at by giant piranhas)?  I mean, mobile phones, much like PDA's and e-mail, liberate us, right?

You've seen those cell phone commercials: "You are now free to move about..blah blah blah..".  Cell phones will make you smarter.  Cell phones will make you trendier.  Cell phones will make you look like you're cool.  Cell phones will keep you <em>in</em> with the <em>in</em>-crowd.  Cell phones will keep you from having to stop talking -- a dangerous situation in which your brain might actually start working.
It is true.  The increased propensity for communication is astonishing.  Nowadays even hikers in the backcountry can stay connected through the advent of (pricey) satellite phones.  So, what could possibly be wrong with all of this communicative revolution?
Well, for one, it imprisons people.  Before cell phones, when you left work, you were completely gone from work.  The only place your boss or any other sinister individual could possibly call to annoy you was at home.  Now these persons can call you anytime, anywhere, and any place as long as you have your phone with you.  ...and... even if you have the phone turned off or are attempting to avoid them by utilizing caller ID, as long as they <i>know</i> you have the phone, they will expect you to return the call eventually.  The same can be said for  wives, husbands, girlfriends, boyfriends, parents, roommates, etc.  Now that we live in the cell phone era, we have placed ourselves in the position of being subjected to the question of "...well, I called your cell phone.  Why didn't you answer or call me back?"

Of course, this is not the biggest of issues.  What is more is that people tend to place greater priority on cell phone conversation than they do on face-to-face interaction.  It seems that, nowadays, it is not considered rude in any way whatsoever to interrupt important meetings or gatherings with cell phone calls.  This astonishes me especially when it happens during a first date.
I have been on numerous first dates, and one not to long in the past, wherein the girl has interrupted whatever it is we were talking about or doing to take cell phone calls.  Some calls have lasted from 10 to 20 minutes.  Even more, I have taken girls out who have put a date on hold to actually <em>make</em> a cell phone call.  On some occasions, the conversation would generally start with her saying something like, "Hey, [insert name] -- I'm just calling to see what's up!  So talk to me..." and so on and so forth...
Now, to me, this is a sign.  It means, "I am not having a good time; I'm bored or intimidated; take me home so I can go out with my friends or something else."  It makes perfect sense to me.  What would <em>you</em> do if you were stuck somewhere alone with some insanely uninteresting, intimidating, or otherwise unfavorable individual?  You would, of course--unless you are afraid of seeming rude or too forward--seek the quickest way out of the precarious situation as quickly as possible.  For almost everybody, a cell phone provides a quick answer to this issue.

So, in such situations, I attempt to oblige.  I say, once whoever it is finally gets off the phone, to be amicable, "Hey, whadda ya know?  It's already getting late!  Do you need to get going or anything?"

More often than not, the response is usually, "What do you mean?  I'm having a great time!" or something along those lines, to which the girl picks up her cell phone and proceeds to call somebody <em>else</em> to see "what is up" for fifteen <i>more</i> minutes while I stare at my plate.

I am even more confused at the end of the night when I say, "Whelp, that was fun.  See you around sometime, huh?" and I get a response along the lines of, "Yeah, it was great! Do you want to do something next week?"  So, my first line of reasoning has thus been falsified.  The only other thing I could think of that would make people want to interrupt everything else they are doing for the all-mighty-cellphone conversation is a psychological and sociological tendency to gravitate towards telephone conversation in lieu of face-to-face contact.  Priorities become blurry when phones are present.
It seems that whenever the phone rings, an individual feels that he or she <em>must</em> answer it, depending on who it is.  After all, it could be important.  (This, of course, makes me feel as if I'm not only taking her on date, but also all of her friends and all of her family, etc., etc.)  In terms of people actually <em>making</em> calls, however, I am stumped.  Would someone please explain to me why people feel they have to make phone calls on dates if the reason is <em>not</em> that they are attempting to evade their date?

One thing is certain.  I have yet to meet a girl who is inclined to turn her phone off when she gets an incoming call during a date, even if both of us seem to be having a really good time.  If I ever meet somebody who does, I think I'll keep her.
