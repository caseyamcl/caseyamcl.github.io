In this world, there are people who do good things, and then there are simply good people.

I had the pleasure tonight, after the Airport Day of Doom, of partaking in the philanthropy of a good person.

You see, I was to leave Chicago O'Hare today around 4 o'clock, get on a connector flight in Atlanta at 10:00 o'clock, and meet a girl I recently met, Amanda, at the airport at 11:15 where she would be picking me up.  All seemed well until they postponed my flight at O'Hare until 6:30!

This wasn't good.  After much, much, much negotiating with the Delta people and running around the airport like a madman, I managed to get on a 4:30 flight.  Then, this flight became delayed until 6.  Arg!  Then, I almost didn't get a seat on it at all!  Arg!  Then I did.  Whew!  Then, the plane took almost an hour to actually take off.  We sat in the airplane, riding around the O'Hare runways for long enough to become really acquainted with them.  Eventually, we started seeing things we'd seen before.  "Hey, Joe!  There's that sign that says M with the big arrow on it again!"  It was not good times, really though.

Then, by some miracle, the plane actually went down one of the runways and lifted into the air.  By this time, many of us had begun to wonder if the plane was actually capable of this action, or if they planned on driving us to Atlanta.

Anyhow, we arrived in Atlanta at around 10 o'clock, which was fifteen minutes before my connector flight to Tallahassee.  No big deal, though.  The connector flight was delayed...

Instead of leaving at 10:15, it was now scheduled to leave at midnight and arrive in Tallahassee at around 1:15 a.m.  I called Amanda and told her to scratch the plans and get some sleep.  She told me to keep her posted, but she'd try to be there at 1:15, which is ungodly for somebody who has a psychology test the next day!

In any case, after the gate changed, and I trekked 1/4 of the way across <i>that</i> airport, which seemed even busier than O'Hare, I found where the plane supposedly was that would take me home, back to my apartment -- and my bed.

Then, the flight got delayed again.  Only 20 minutes this time; no big deal.  We eventually boarded and waited for the vessel to do something.  ..and waited.. ..and waited..

Eventually, the captain's voice came over the loudpseaker informing us that there was some missing paperwork dealing with the luggage weight distribution and standard fuel tank weight for Delta operating procedures to comply with the FAA or something.  In any case, we weren't going to go anywhere until the "paperwork" came.  So, there I was again, sitting next to some big fat guy who didn't speak English very well, in an airplane, but not actually flying anywhere.

And we waited..

And one o'clock went by.

And we waited..

And two o'clock went by.

And we waited..

And then!  What do you know?  The paperwork came!  So, we lifted off the ground, and then the captain informed us that the flight would "take a little longer" than expected due to weather.  By this time, the passengers were about ready to hijack the plane using fingernail clippers, souvener chopsticks, Starbucks coffee, or whatever other makeshift weapons we could conjur up.  Fortunately, we landed in Tallahassee eventually.

It was three a.m. sharp.  I was sure I'd be calling a taxi to come get me.  But, nope, there she was, all sprawled out on the bench, sleeping.  Amanda, whom I have only known for a few weeks, stayed in the world's Most Boring Airport for three hours waiting on me to come in.  I was delerious and guilt-ridden.  I owe her one big time.

So, we went to Steak 'n' Shake afterwards, and now, it's five o'clock.  Work begins in three hours.  I am contemplating getting two hours sleep or simply just pulling through.

What do you think?
