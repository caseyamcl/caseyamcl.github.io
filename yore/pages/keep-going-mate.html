This weekend has been an exercise in endurance.  Actually, it has consisted of several exercises in endurance.  Allow me to elaborate:

It all started on Friday afternoon.  The sun was just starting to edge its way into the lower western hemisphere over FSU when I finished up with my peer advising duties at the Information Studies Administrative desk on campus.  I was the last person to leave the office that day, and because of the excruciatingly insane week at work, I made it my resolution to not work one iota this weekend more than necessary.  I was going to take it easy, and do whatever it was that <em>I</em> wanted to do.  Namely, see some movies, go to the gym, and go out with friends.

Well, the movies part was no problem.  I went home, got some food, and then turned around and went back out to catch a flick at the campus theater.  All good.. no problem.  After some serious movie, I dropped my friend off at his place, and then went home.  I thought about going out, but I figured, "nahh.. I'm going to simply take it easy."

The next day, I got up and decided, "Today I will work out."  So, I went to my internship from one until five p.m.,. went home, changed, and headed to the gym.  That is, I headed to work out for the first time in months.  Now, bear in mind that I have primarily been living off of (a) burritos, (b) cheeseburgers, and (c) donuts for the past few weeks.  I got on the treadmill and ran a mile.  Immediately afterward, I felt kind of like that Greek soldier who ran 25 miles in full armor, yelled "Nike" (victory), and then collapsed dead.  I figured that it was also my time to go, only I couldn't even utter "urmphh", let alone any coherent word like "Nike".  Any pride I had in running that mile so enduringly was superseded by the drool uncontrollably coming out of my mouth and the fact that I thought I had probably just killed myself.  But, I survived, and proceeded to finish my regimen and then shower at my apartment.

Even though the mile was difficult, nothing would prepare me for the test of endurance I was about to endure.

You see, after working out for an hour, my body lost a lot of water.  But, I had only about forty minutes to clean up and replenish that water before I had to go out again.  So, wisely, I drank as much as I could.  I mean, I drank more water in 20 minutes than I had in the previous two days combined, I'm pretty sure.  Then, I proceeded to head out to the Lab Theater at FSU to see a three-act show with some of my good friends.  You can see where this is going...

Let me tell you:  When you input a lot of water into your body within a relatively short period of time, be sure to expel some of that water before you have to sit in a theater, placed in the seat which is arguably <i>the furthest</i> away from the restroom, for several hours.

The show was a series of MFA directing thesis projects, which are three separate one-acts done on the same night, in the same theater, with a 10-minute intermission between each show.  The first could not have been worse for a person in my situation.  The scene took place in a quarantined apartment in New York City, and the characters were locked in a very graphic dispute over whether or not they should copulate.  I mean, this was not a show that you would want to take your thirteen year old sister to.  They talked a lot about their lower organs.. you know, the same ones you use to go to the bathroom with?  This did not help.

The scene went on, and on, and on, andonandonandon.  Basically, the scene went as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Guy wakes up and wanders around for a long time.</li>
	<li>Female character arrives.</li>
	<li>Female character begs to copulate.</li>
	<li>Male character refuses.</li>
	<li>They fight.</li>
	<li>Female character gets ready to storm out.</li>
	<li>Male character stops her.</li>
	<li>They agree to "just talk and look at each other"</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 3 - 5 about 50,000 times, as Casey sits there, squirming in the audience, knowing that he can't really make it to the restroom without walking <em>through</em> the stage (the lab theater is set up kind of strangely).</li>
	<li>The two characters, after much arguing, finally agree to copulate.</li>
	<li>Blackout</li>
</ol>
Perhaps the worst element of the situation of all was that we happened to be sitting not only furthest away from the restroom, but right behind a set piece which consisted of about thirty 20-oz., plastic bottles of water.  After a while, I swore they were looking at me and laughing.

The house lights were still coming up on the audience as I painfully made my way across the stage floor and to the restroom.  I went back to my seat, maybe with less dignity, but feeling completely rejuvenated.  Such relief.  I was extremely happy that I had that little episode behind me.  It was all good.

Fast forward twenty minutes.  Now we were in Act II, which was a incredibly hilarious satire on those "emergency preparedness" seminars that paranoid people go to.  It was very funny, and I was enjoying myself, until ...it happened again.. this time worse than before.  It's like I had a medical condition or something!  My friend leaned over eventually, and said, "Are you having a seizure or something?"
I said, "ummrmmph."
She said, "Stop doing that!"

I said "ummrmmph!!"

Just about then, the lights came up on our section of the audience.  I froze and now, everybody was looking in my general direction.  You see, the show was "interactive" at this point, which means, occasionally, the characters would interact with the audience.  The fact that there was a spotlight now shining on my head was, to say the least, extremely upsetting in my present situation.

I made it through that, though.  I eventually couldn't take it anymore, and I turned around and loudly went out the emergency exit, <i>ran</i> around to the front of the building, and cursed the fact that the human body has developed in such a way as to warrant the need of restrooms.

The rest of the evening actually went pretty well.  I had no further endurance tests.. Until today.

Today, I decided that I wasn't going to give up on this working out thing just because I almost obliterated myself the first time.  Since it was such a nice day, I went and actually ran down my road.  I figured I'd go up this road called "High Road" and then loop back down Ocala Road to my apartment.  Not an incredible distance compared to what I used to run in the past, but still enough.  Well, they call it "High Road" for a reason.  It's high, as in high in altitude.  In order to get to the high altitude of which "High Road" is named, you have to climb a hill, or, in my situation, attempt to run up it.  I had forgotten this small detail when I had chosen the route.  Nevertheless, I went up the hill.

Not to reiterate the same story (de ja vu), but by the time I got back to my apartment, I collapsed on the sofa and refused <i>ever</i> to move again.  If I could have conjured the strength to write my will, I might have done it right then.  I moaned, "ummmrrmmphh."

But, again, I survived.  All of the stress this weekend caused me to become very hungry, so I decided that I'd go to the cafeteria on campus, since it's all-you-can-eat, and cheap.  Or so I thought.

They charged me $7.50.  Yeah, apparently, they upped the rate.  So, I paid it and swore that I was going to get my money's worth.

"I will eat as much as humanly possible," I said to myself, out loud.  A girl standing next to me giggled.

So, first I got a hamburger; then I got an omelet; then I got fries; then I got something I can pronounce, etc. etc.  Of course, I was full way before I had finished eating, but I decided that there was no way I was leaving <i>yet</i>, because those jerks charged me $7.50! (which, come to think of it, isn't exactly a lot for all-you-can-eat).  Regardless, I ate more than what physics dictates is possible, and upon leaving, I yet again felt like I was going to keel over.

But, I survived.  Now, I'm all good.

Urrrmmmgghhh
