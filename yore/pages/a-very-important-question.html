In creating my profile for the blogging software I use, I was confronted by a question:
<h2>Which is better to make a model airplane out of: a banana peel or a wet sock?</h2>
So, I answered it:
<blockquote>
To answer this question, we must first conceptualize the purpose of any flight machine, which is, of course, to levitate above the ground and propel itself forward independently of any other objects.

This being true, we must take into consideration some simple aerodynamic principles.  The main factors are weight (W), lift (L), thrust (T), and drag (D).  As we are all well aware, the following conditions must be satisfied for any object to stay aloft:

&nbsp;&nbsp;T = D and L = W

While most all airplanes use jet or combustion engines to satisfy the T = D requirement, and have wings in order to direct the flow of air as to provide a lifting force so that L = W.

For our purposes, however, we must assume that a banana peel or a wet sock does not have the inherent capacity to support any kind of propelling aparatus, so the source of thrust is assumed to be nothing more than a good throw by a strong arm, which will keep the apparatus aloft for only a finite period of time.

Thus, the challenge is in determining which of the two, the banana peel or the wet sock, will be able to maintain lift for a longer period of time.  This brings us to the issue of how to fashion each object into a lift-inducing shape.

To consider the banana peel, the most logical manipulation of the object into a winged apparatus would be the converting of some parts of the peel into rigid wings by the use of a pencil, pen, or other similar ojbect bonded to the peel with a lightweight bonding solution.  Assuming that the length of each peel section is 20cm (a reasonable assumption), the wingspan of the banana-peel-plane would be 40cm, or 1.31233596 feet.  The peel slices not used to fashion the wings would also be made rigid and positioned perpendicular to the wings in order to reduce drag.

For the wet sock, we must apply a rigid device shaped like a plus sign (+) to put inside the sock in order to provide it with a wingspan and a rigid perpendicular section to reduce drag.  A long stick fastened together with a pencil should serve this purpose, with the wingspan being the long stick, and the pencil being the perpendicular rigid section of the airplane.  The apparatus will be diamond-shaped.  If we take into account the average length of a sock (men's 8-12 size), we get a wingspan (W) of 42 cm, or 1.37795276 feet.  We will assume that the length of the perpendicular section (Lp) is the length of a short pencil (17.5 cm or 0.574146982 feet).  To get the area, we must divide the diamond into two triangles and then find the sum of the area of the two triangles:

&nbsp;&nbsp;As = (Lp * (.5)(W/2)) * 2 = 0.39557371 sq ft.

For the banana peel, assuming Lp = 5 cm (0.164041995 ft), the area of the wing (W) will be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab = 0.10763910 sq. ft.

Now, for flying conditions, let's assume that we are able to mold these devices into a standard NACA 1408 airfoil shape, and that the angle we throw these things into the air will be 4 degrees above the horizon.  In addition, let's assume, since I'm located in sunny Florida, that I'm standing on the beach at sea level on a more or less windless day.  Also, I'd calculate my throwing ability to be able to project these things at about 70 mph (slower than a fast pitch in baseball).

So, we have a few constants and two variables:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ab = 0.10763910 sq. ft.
&nbsp;&nbsp;As = 0.39557371 sq. ft.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cl = 0.55 (lift coeffiecent for standard 1408 airfoil @ 4 degrees)
&nbsp;&nbsp;rho = 0.002377 slg/ ft(^2) (at sea level)
&nbsp;&nbsp;V = 102.67 ft/s

Using these data, I use the standard lift equation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;L = Cl * 1/2 * p * V(^2) * A

So, under these conditions, the lift for the banana would be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lb = .55 * .5 * .0023769 * 102.67 * 102.67 * 0.10763910 = 0.74165305 lbs

The lift for the sock would be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ls = .55 * .5 * .0023769 * 102.67 * 102.67 * 0.39557371 = 2.72557507 lbs

So, as can be seen by implementing simple aerodynamic principles and some creative structural solutions, the wet sock would definitely make a better model airplane due to its increased propensity to maintain lift.</blockquote>
There you have it.
