I have had a lot of steps in my speedy maturation as a manager.  No longer do have the luxary of sitting at work collecting rubber bands in my Rubber Band Collection Cup<sup>(tm)</sup> and updating my weblog.  Now I must delegate, coordinate, inspire, motivate, and make people do stuff!  It hasn't been an easy task, and I have fumbled quite a few times.

It has been very difficult, actually, getting accumulated to this environment of uncertainty and make-it-or-break-it rules of the game.  The number of hours I used to work while an undergraduate hovered around 50 - 60 hours, if I included Work I, Work II, 15 undergrad. credit hours, tutoring, homework, and my 8 hour internship.  I thought that was a lot.  Somebody told me (I think it was my brother) that once you get a full-time job, your life opens back up again.  Ha ha.

Now I am up to 60-80 hour workweeks if I count my beastly job, tutoring, and graduate school courses.  On top of all that, I am sure there are other things going on, but wow.  I am by no means complaining, but things certainly get busier, not the opposite.  And it can be stressful.

This weekend, I will be writing up a draft of server technologies that I believe myself and the network coordinator are familiar with.  I will be putting together a comprehensive list of performance objectives, both project-oriented and maintenance-oriented, for our servers.  I will be pricing out certification tests and submitting a proposal to my boss at work.  All on Saturday.  How am I going to go out and party tonight?!

On top of that, I have several great ideas for this website that don't seem to ever get off the ground:

* Global Template Redesign
* Better Database Integration (which has been mapped out; just not coded yet)
* A pHp-based dhtml Photo Album that I will publish as open source on the 'net (halfway done)
* An R & D page
* A global mathematical toolbox for people who need to have quick oddball things done, like conversions between encoded text and non-encoded strings
* Another open source personal text encryption routine that hides messages within messages (pretty spiffy - came up with the algorithm my freshman year of college)
* A staging site for a literary-based research project I am thinking of starting.
* etc.
