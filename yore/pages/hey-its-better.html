Hello all:

In case you haven't already noticed, this site looks a bit different.  I had Anna "Decorate <i>this</i>" Guterman and Brian "I didn't really contribute so much as complain" Bielfelt come in and give me their 123's on visual design, and I changed a number of other elements, too. Ahem:
<ul>
	<li>My site looks prettier. It now adheres to the all important principles of CRAP (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity for you non info. studies majors out there)</li>
	<li>The comment is new and improved. No longer does it open that annoying little, miniature, use-a-microscope-to-read-this pop-up window. Pop-ups are the devil, anyhow, and I've been meaning to remove them from this site since the day I developed that one.</li>
	<li>Speaking of size, it definitely does matter. At least, that's what I've been told. That's why the text size is a bit bigger than before.</li>
	<li>A few extra thanks: Jordan, I stole some of your code.  I'll pay you back in Subway coupons.</li>
	<li>Note the rounded boxes, courtesy of an illegal copy of Photoshop CS provided by Mike.</li>
	<li>Also, I would personally like to thank the town of <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&address=&amp;city=Casey&amp;state=IA">Casey, Iowa</a> for providing me with the really cool road sign picture.</li>
</ul>
So, please let me know what you think. I did nothing productive today in order to bring you this site, and now it's 12:50 a.m., so I am a bit beat.

Cheers!
