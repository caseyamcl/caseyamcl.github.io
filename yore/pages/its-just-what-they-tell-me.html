title: 'It''s Just What They Tell Me'

Very recently, I posted a piece detailing what would probably happen if an immaculately timed meteor decided to cross Earth's path.  Some people tell me that it's a little morbid and a bit pessimistic.  I also <em>might</em> have written some things about aliens invading, nuclear bombs going off, some plague or something, and inadvertent black hole creation.  But, the "we may all die instantly any second" mentality was pretty much the theme of that particular post.

I'm really an <span style="text-decoration: line-through ">optometrist</span>, I mean optimist!

But, everybody is telling me to be afraid (BE VERY AFRAID) all the time.  Last week it was the meteors, this week it's some kind of atmospheric pressure thing that could kill us all.  According to one particular scientist, if Greenland has a warm front, the whole world could be doomed.  I mean, it seems as if one little discrepancy in this crazy planet of ours will kill us all.

Then, there's micro-level destruction!  Apparently, carbohydrates are bad for you again.  I think I heard that they were bad for you way back in the '60's, too, but since then, "scientists" have decided that they are, in fact, okay.  But, now they're bad again!  What is it??  And eggs... what about eggs?  "Eat plenty," I used to hear, "They're brain food."  Then, it's "Don't eat any!  They will cause heart disease!"  Then, it's "Eat exactly four and a half per week -- any less will eventually kill you; any more will eventually kill you."  Arg!

You know what?  I'm still alive, and if you're reading this, you're still alive.  I'll eat all the eggs I want.. and movie theater popcorn, and root beer, and hotdogs, and the gum I find on the bottom of desks (okay, I'm joking on that one), and I'm not going to worry about the CFC's or whatever they're called floating around the atmosphere, because I can't see them, and I'm not going to worry about meteors or aliens or anything else that may want to come to Earth and probe me in uncomfortable places!  So, that's that.

Really, I'm not!
