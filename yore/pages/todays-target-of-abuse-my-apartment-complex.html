They deserve it.

Way back in March of last year, against the strong pleading and advising of my friends, my family, other residents, and, I'm pretty sure, even God Almighty, I decided to let bygones be bygones and re-sign my lease at University Commons for another year.  They had, after all, finally (I'm talking after many months of asking) came by and cleaned the vomit stain off my floor and fixed the front door so that burglars would be slightly more deterred (relatively speaking) from coming in and taking anything that isn't nailed down, such as my prized collection of refrigerated expired meat or my mold-shower-curtain science project (which reflects five months of study).

Of course, for those readers who aren't aware of what happened in my first year of tenancy at University Commons, I will briefly summarize the several minor problems that occurred:
<ol>
	<li>We were without phone, Internet, or any other modern means of communication for approximately six months last year.  This forced me to often have to walk down to the corner and use a pay phone.  The rest of the time, I pretty much yielded to being cut off from the rest of the world and society altogether.  The management at University Commons was helpful throughout the entire ordeal, however, by informing us on a weekly basis that the phone would be fixed "next week".</li>
	<li>The amenities were working as well as they could have been, meaning that the amenities were not working at all.  The staff had accommodatingly converted the gymnasium into storage, refused to turn the jacuzzi on (it has been in repairs on and off now for 15 months), refused to turn the lights on at the tennis courts (they're waiting until "tomorrow"), failed to clean the pool (which is now more of a plasma than actual liquid); and the game room had pool tables, but no pool balls or pool cues, or ..well.. anything else.</li>
	<li>The highly touted "computer lab" consisted of a single dilapidated computer available from eight a.m. to seven p.m. Monday - Friday, which was almost constantly occupied by this one guy browsing Internet Personal Ads on www.hotornot.com.</li>
	<li>While <em>I</em> thought of the parking lot as a place to park my car, University Commons thought of it more as a place to practice their towing skills.  In that regard, they decided that it would be a great idea to tow my car TWICE last winter, even though I did, in fact, live there.  After several weeks of arguing with the management over this issue, we concluded the matter with the manager stating that she would "take care of it tomorrow".  Tomorrow has still not yet arrived.</li>
	<li>The highly effective University Commons roommate matching service (a sophisticated quantitative computer made of spare bicycle parts) determined that my ideal roommate match would be a 33-year old former college dropout whose favorite hobbies are drinking before 10 a.m., buying and lighting incense from the Dollar General Store, getting lost in the apartment complex only to be returned 20 minutes later by other tenants whom I don't know claiming that we need to "put him in his room and lock the door", and scaring girls away from any social gatherings that have happened to occur at our apartment from time to time.</li>
	<li>The closet was broken, the bathroom sink wouldn't produce cold water, the shower was falling apart, there were apparently dead animals embedded in the carpet, the sofa was made mostly out of metal, the sink flooded the kitchen one day (we made the mistake of using the dishwasher), the washing machine regularly walked across the floor, the apartment a level above us liked to leak water into ours, lights didn't work, the front door had to be kicked in to actually be opened (security feature, I guess), and beer cans, various food items, and actual people were constantly falling from the third level balcony of our building.</li>
	<li>Somebody actually <em>stole</em> my bird-crazy roommate's (long story), bird-feeders from outside our apartment.  We initially thought it was squirrels, but no squirrel (short of a mutant squirrel) could have penetrated Brian's squirrel-proof wire-bound bird-feeder protection system.  It was traumatizing for him; he still swears retribution to this day even though he has long since moved out.</li>
</ol>
The list does go on, but I believe that the above examples demonstrate some of the minor inconveniences me and my roommates (the sober ones) experienced over the first year of my tenancy.  But, come March I decided, hey, let's let's not be over judgmental or anything, and I re-signed my lease.  My theory on the subject is that my body was temporarily possessed by demons at the time of making that particular decision, but nevertheless, I did it.  University Commons was extremely elated about the deal, being that I was most likely the only person to re-sign in the entire complex.  They even credited $50.00 towards my rent.

It was the single stupidest decision since the beginning of time when the universe erupted into existence from a tiny, microscopic particle.  Since then, things have not improved one iota from the day I moved in.
<ol>
	<li>The phone now works (woo-hoo), but the Internet was still nonfunctional for an entire semester.  This was apparently partly due to a series of events that one could label as ironic.  Evidently, several students complained about the fact that the apartment complex was making them pay for caller-ID and call-waiting, when they were not in fact receiving those benefits.  This caused the apartment complex to dutifully inquire about this with the phone company, who informed them that they'd rather stick their head in an industrial sized bread-dough mixer than shell out the features.  So, the apartment complex refused to pay the bill.  So, the phone company removed their equipment.  So, the apartment complex sued them.  So, the tenants <em>still</em> had no phone or Internet.</li>
	<li>I received, quite capriciously one day, a letter informing me that I owed the apartment complex approximately $600.00 in past due expenses, and if I did not pay this bill within three days, they would regretfully, but forcefully banish me out on the streets.  I, of course, was not aware that I had failed in my financial obligations, so I marched down to the office and asked kindly exactly what it was that I owed for, being that they had failed to put that apparently insignificant detail on their letter.  After much parsing by the office manager, I was subsequently informed that they had made some "minor mistakes", and the amount was incorrect.  I did still owe them money, however: one dollar and sixty five cents.</li>
	<li>My car, which was once again innocently sitting in the parking lot, minding its own business, was violated, monetarily speaking, in the amount of $250.00 when somebody attempted to take it even though it was mine.  This happened one night, and although the perpetrators were too stupid to actually (a) successfully steal the car, or (b) think enough to steal anything out of the car, they did manage to damage the ignition switch, causing me to have to have to have it fixed.  The apartment people felt very responsible however, and issued an official apology: "Bummer."</li>
</ol>
The list goes on as well, but this post is already long enough...  As you can see, though, University Commons has been slacking to the point of forcing me to issue my retribution in the form of this Internet posting.  I swear, I was forced to complain, really.  But you should consider it a public service announcement:

University Commons Bad!  Any other Place: Not as Bad!

That is all.
